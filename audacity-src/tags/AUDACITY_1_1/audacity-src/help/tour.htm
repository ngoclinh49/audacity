<p>

Welcome!  This page will give you an idea of some of the possible

things you can do with <b>Audacity</b> and walk you through the

process.



<ul>



<li><a href="#tour1">Recording a sound effect for your computer</a>

<p>



<li><a href="#tour2">Splitting an MP3 into two separate files</a>

<p>



<li><a href="#tour3">Mixing background music with a voiceover</a>

<b>Recording a sound effect for your computer</b>

<p>



This assumes that you have a microphone attached to your computer.



<ul>



<li>Open the Preferences, click on the Audio I/O tab, and make sure

    that the appropriate input device is selected.

    

<li>Click the Record button.  Make a noise.  Click Stop.



<li>Listen to your sound using the Play button.



<li>Select All and then experiment with some of the effects in

    the Effect menu.

    

<li>Choose Export as WAV... and save your sound as a WAV file.

    You can now use this file in any other program which lets you

    customize its sound effects, such as your email program.



</ul>

<p>

<b>Splitting an MP3 into two separate files</b>

<p>



(Before you try to export MP3 files, read the section on

<a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a> for some

important information on steps you need to do first.)



<p>



<ul>



<li>Open the MP3 file.

    

<li>Select the part of it that you want to be the first file.

    Listen to it by clicking the Play button.



<li>While this part is selected, choose

    Export Selection as MP3... from the File menu.



<li>Now select the part you want to be the other song and

    Export again.



</ul>

<p>

<b>Mixing background music with a voiceover</b>

<p>



Audacity makes it very easy to mix two different sounds together.



<p>



<ul>



<li>Open one sound (for example, the background music).

    

<li>Select Import Audio... from the Project menu and open

    the other sound (for example, the voiceover).



<li>Listen to your sound using the Play button.  <b>Audacity</b>

    automatically mixes them together.



<li>Choose the <a href="toolbar.htm#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool

    and adjust the position of one track or the other until

    they're synchronized the way you want them.

    You can even move tracks around while they're playing.



<li>If you hear clipping which wasn't present in either of the

    original files, it means that the combined volume of the two

    tracks is too loud.  Select one or both of the tracks and

    then use the Amplify... effect to reduce the volumes until

    you don't hear clipping anymore.

    

<li>Export as a WAV or MP3 file.



</ul>

<p>

<b>Recording harmonies with yourself</b>

<p>



<ul>



<li>Open the Preferences, click on the Audio I/O tab, and

    check the box marked Play While Recording.

    

<li>Click the Record button.  Record yourself singing.  Click Stop.



<li>Click the Record button again.

    The first track you recorded will play, but <b>Audacity</b>

    will also record a new track at the same time, allowing

    you to sing harmony with yourself.



<li>When you play the two tracks you recorded

    together, they probably won't be synchronized.

    This is normal and is not the

    fault of <b>Audacity</b>.  To fix it, you will need to grab the

    <a href="toolbar.htm#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool and slide one

    of the tracks around until it sounds right.    



</ul>
