<b>Undo</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This will undo the last editing operation you 
performed to your project.  Audacity supports full unlimited undo&nbsp;&mdash; 
meaning you can undo every editing operation back to when you opened the window.
<p>

<b>Redo</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This will redo any editing operations that were just 
undone. After you perform a new editing operation, you can no longer redo the 
operations that were undone.
<p>

<b>Cut</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Removes the selected audio data and places it on the 
clipboard. Only one "thing" can be on the clipboard at a time, but it may contain 
multiple tracks.
<p>

<b>Split Cut</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Removes the selected audio data and places it on 
the clipboard, splitting the track into two clips.
<p>

<b>Copy</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Copies the selected audio data to the clipboard without
removing it from the project.
<p>

<b>Paste</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Inserts whatever is on the clipboard at the position 
of the selection or cursor in the project, replacing whatever audio data is 
currently selected, if any.
<p>

<b>Trim</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Removes everything to the left and right of the selection.
<p>

<b>Delete</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Removes the audio data that is currently selected 
without copying it to the clipboard.
<p>

<b>Split Delete</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Removes the audio data that is currently selected 
without copying it to the clipboard and splitting the track into two clips.
<p>

<b>Silence</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Erases the audio data currently selected, replacing 
it with silence instead of removing it.
<p>

<b>Split</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Moves the selected region into its own track or tracks,
replacing the affected portion of the original track with silence.

<b>Join</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Merges selected clips into one, filling space between 
them with silence.
<p>

<b>Disjoin</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Examines a selected region and splits the region 
into separate clips deleting the silent parts.

<b>Labeled Regions...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; stores editing functions, described above, 
to apply to labeled regions, namely: <i>Cut</i>, <i>Split Cut</i>, <i>Copy</i>, 
<i>Delete</i>, <i>Split Delete</i>, <i>Silence</i>, <i>Split</i>, <i>Join</i>, 
<i>Disjoin</i>.
<p>

<b>Select...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; stores several functions to select audio in all of 
the tracks, namely:

<ul>
<li><b>All</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Selects all of the audio in all of the tracks.</li>

<li><b>Left at Playback Position</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Selects all audio to the left from 
the playback position.</li>

<li><b>Right at Playback Position</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Selects all audio to the right from 
the playback position.</li>

<li><b>Start to Cursor</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Selects from the beginning of the selected
tracks to the cursor position.</li>

<li><b>Cursor to End</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Selects from the cursor position to the end
of the selected tracks.</li>
</ul><p>

<b>Find Zero Crossings</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Modifies the selection slightly so that both
the left and right edge of the selection appear on a positive-slope zero crossing. 
This makes it easier to cut and paste audio without resulting in a large audible 
clicking sound.
<p>

<b>Selection Save</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Remembers the current selection (or cursor position),
allowing you to restore it later.
<p>

<b>Selection Restore</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Restores the cursor position to the last position
saved by "Selection Save".
<p>

<p><b>Move Cursor..</b>&nbsp;&mdash; stores commands to move the cursor to diferent 
positions within the projectm namely:
<ul>
<li><b>to Track Start</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Moves the cursor to the start
of the current track.</li>
<li><b>to Track End</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Move the cursor to the end of the currently selected 
track.</li>
<li><b>to Selection Start</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Moves the cursor to the start of the current 
selection.</li>
<li><b>to Selection End</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Moves the cursor to the end of the current 
selection.</li></ul><br><p>

<b>Selection Save</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Remembers current selection.
<br><p>

<b>Selection Restore</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Restores previously remembered selection.
<br><p>

<b>Snap-To ... &gt; Snap On</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Enable Snap-To mode. When Snap-To mode is 
enabled, the selection will be constrained to the nearest interval, by default the 
nearest second. So if you click and drag from 4.2 seconds to 9.8 seconds, it will 
result in a selection from 4 seconds to 10 seconds, exactly.  You can change the units 
that are snapped to using the "Set Selection Format" option in the 
<a href="menu_view.htm">View Menu</a>.
<p>

<b>Snap-To ... &gt; Snap Off</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Turns Snap-To mode off, letting you 
select arbitrary ranges of time.
<p>

<b>Preferences...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; opens the <a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a>
dialog.
