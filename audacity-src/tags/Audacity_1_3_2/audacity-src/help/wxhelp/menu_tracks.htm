<h1>Tracks Menu</h1>

<b>Add New Track</b>&nbsp;&mdash; a submenu that groups function to add 
new track of different types, namely:

<ul><li><b>Audio Track</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This creates a new empty
<a href="track_audio.htm">Audio Track</a>. This command is rarely needed, 
since importing, recording, and mixing automatically create new tracks as 
needed. But you can use this to cut or copy data from an existing track 
and paste it into a blank track. If that track was at a non-default rate 
then you may need to use Set Rate from the 
<a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down</a> menu to set the correct sample 
rate.</li>

<li><b>Stereo Track</b>&nbsp;&mdash;  same as above, but creates a 
stereo track. You can also create a stereo track by joining two tracks 
using the <a href="menu_track.htm"> track pop-down menu</a>.</li>

<li><b>Label Track</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This creates a new 
<a href="track_label.htm">Label Track</a>, which can be very useful for 
textual annotation.</li>

<li><b>Time Track</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This creates a new 
<a href="track_time.htm">Time Track</a>, which is used to vary the speed 
of playback over time.</li></ul>
<p>

<b>Stereo to Mono </b>&nbsp;&mdash; This command mixes current stereo 
track into a mono  track.<p>

<b>Mix and Render</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This command mixes all of the selected 
tracks together. If you are mixing stereo tracks, or mixing tracks that are 
marked as Left or Right channel, the result will be a stereo track 
(two channels), otherwise the result will be mono.
<p>
Your tracks are implicitly mixed whenever you hit the Play button and 
whenever you export. This command offers a way to do it permanently and 
save the results to disk, saving on playback  resources.
<p>
Note that if you try to mix two very loud tracks together, you may get 
clipping (it will sound like pops, clicks, and noise). To avoid this, drag 
the gain slider on the tracks down to reduce their volume before mixing.
<p>

<b>Remove Tracks</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This command removes the selected track 
or tracks from the project. Even if only part of a track is selected, the 
entire track is removed. You can also delete a track by clicking the X in 
its upper-left corner. To cut out only part of the audio in a track, use 
<a href="menu_edit.htm#delete">Delete</a> or 
<a href="menu_edit.htm#silence">Silence</a>.
<p>

<b>Align Tracks...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; All the Align functions work on whole 
tracks or groups of tracks, not on selections, even if they span across 
multiple tracks. They all operate by time-shifting tracks (moving them left 
or right), making it easier to synchronize tracks or get rid of silence at 
the beginning.  The cursor or selection stays in the same place unless you 
use "Align and move cursor...", below:
<p>

<b>Align And Move Cursor...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; same as the functions above, 
except that the cursor or selection is moved along with the tracks. That 
allows you to shift the tracks without losing your relative place.
<p>

<b>Add Label At Selection</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This menu item lets you create 
a new label at the current selection. You can title the label by typing with 
the keyboard and then hitting "Enter" when you're done.
<p>

<b>Add Label At Playback Position</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This menu item lets you 
create a new label at the current location where you are playing or recording. 
Do this if you want to mark a certain passage while you're listening to it. 
You can title the label by typing with the keyboard and then hitting "Enter" 
or "Return" when you're done. Only available whilst Audacity is playing.
