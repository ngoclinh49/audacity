<P class=a>
 This is the effect we apply to audio material to give the listener the
 impression he is in another room. Some productions are recorded with
 stereo MIC-ing techniques and they hardly require any extra room information
 since they're mostly recorded in places you may listen to the music live,
 such as clubs and concert halls(classical music).
</P>
<P class=a>
 Most people don't have that luxury or simply want finer control over this
 kind of room information. Pop music is the most obvious example, where nothing
 is supposed to actualy sound like a real room. It just needs to sound good.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Digital Reverbs give you a large degree of control nowadays and they are powerful
 tools in creating the illusion of spaces that weren't there when the material
 was recorded. Especially when this material was recorded in rooms with very
 little reflection and reverb themselves, which is in no way by accident. To illustrate
 why this is possible, let's take a look at how sound 'reverberates'.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Let's assume you're standing in a room, about in the middle. Your girlfriend
 walks in through a door in the wall, which you are facing, and starts
 yelling at you for wasting your time on computers. What do you hear ?
</P>
<P class=a>
 The first thing you'll hear is the <B>DIRECT SOUND</B>. With an air temperature of
 20 degrees Celcius sound will move with 343 meter per second(+/-0.6 meters per degrees). So the DIRECT
 SOUND will be upon you almost instantly, depending on how far away you were
 from it. Audio people also call this the <B>DRY</B> part of the sound.
 All that comes after it is refered to as the WET part of the sound, which
 a reverb effect plugin is supposed to create.
</P>

<P class=a>
 The second thing you'll hear only milliseconds later, actualy more than
 one 'thing', since there is more than one wall, are the <B>EARLY REFLECTIONS</B>.
 The first reflections that hit you, are coming from the left and right walls,
 as well as the floor and ceiling. The next reflection will be the ones that have hit two walls
 before arriving at your ears.
</P>
<P class=a>
 For our brain, these <B>EARLY REFLECTIONS</B> are the most important component for
 identifying the size of a room.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The sound will reflect again and again, and in time(milliseconds
 remember?), as the reflections weaken and the sound is dispersed more and
 more, you'll be unable to identify individual reflections. What develops now
 is the <B>REVERB</B>. It has an attack time and reaches it's peak after a few
 milliseconds, depending on the room we're in.
</P>
<P class=a>
 PRE-DELAY is what we call the time between the DIRECT SOUND and the first peak
 level of the REVERB.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Naturally the sound fades as the sound reverberates across the room.
 We refer to the time it takes to drop to an almost unhearable level(-60dB)
 as the REVERB TIME.
</P>
<P class=a>
 I'll introduce a few more important factors in a moment.
 Professional hard- and software gives you many more parameters to
 play with but the ones above are universal to most reverb effects.

<P class=qr>An example by the numbers</P>

<P class=a>
 As an example I'd like to show you how to create a reverb for small club
 with a band.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Let's see what we have to do with parameters in the reverb fx in sample
 editors. First we determine some basics about the room we want to simulate.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Our room(the club) is about eight meters on all sides(for simplicity)
 and three meters high. The band will be playing no more than four meters
 away from us. The room volume will be about 200 cubic meters.
</P>
<P class=a>
 This means that the DIRECT SOUND will get to you within about
 11 ms (milliseconds). This the time we'll need to take off the other values.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The first EARLY REFLECTIONS (off the left and right walls) travel
 around nine meters before reaching you, so they'll get to your ears about
 15 ms later! (9 meters at 343 meters/sec -> 26 ms minus the 11 ms the DIRECT
 SOUND takes to travel to your ears).
</P>
<P class=a>
 I'm not taking the floor into account because of the obstacles, such as your
 own legs and a table that prevents that reflection from the band from
 reaching you.It is also probable that your sitting close to a wall and
 EARLY REFLECTION time may drop considerably. Experiment and listen very
 carefully.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The reason I'm deducting 11 ms from the 26 ms is that in a sample editor
 we already have the DIRECT SOUND.
 In Cool Edit an EARLY REFLECTIONS parameter doesn't exist. In Soundforge
 however there are a few ER times to choose from. We choose whatever is
 closest to 15 ms.
 Please note that the timing of the EARLY REFLECTIONS are defined by the
 rooms characteristics such as shape and size. The sound colour of the
 EARLY REFLECTIONS is defined by the surfaces in the room.These are parameters
 that are available to professional reverbs only(hard- or software), so don't
 worry about not finding that stuff in great detail in either Soundforge or
 CoolEditPro.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The PRE-DELAY and REVERB TIME depend on more than just room size.
 Wall and floor material, as well as anything else that reflects, disperses
 and dampens sound will influence the reverb in quite a few ways.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Our club has lots of wood on it's walls and floor and people are sitting
 at tables and the air's probably filled with a little smoke(except in
 California :).
</P>
<P class=a>
 The REVERB TIME, a parameter found in all sample editors, should be set to
 no more than one second. In small, crowded rooms where little REVERB occurs
 it is quite important to set the EARLY REFLECTIONS right. Experiment with
 the reverb time keep it lower than 1.2 seconds and above 0.7 seconds.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The PRE-DELAY can be set to 30 ms or more. Larger rooms will develop REVERB
 later since the reflecting sound will travel a while before the reflections
 become hard to identify but it also depends on the reflecting materials.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Both Cool Edit and Soundforge have parameters referring to the DENSITY of the
 REVERB part of the sound. Materials such as polished marble will reflect the
 sound very well and disperse the sound very little. Wood disperses the sound
 a lot and a carpet practically swallows a large chunk of it.
 For our Club we need to set the density high since our material disperses the
 sound a lot(humans,wood and obstacles).
</P>
<P class=a>
 Higher frequencies are swallowed a lot faster than low frequencies.
 Many reverb algorythems refer to this in some form or another. Cool Edit
 has the 'High Frequency Absorbtion Time' as a parameter for this.
 Sound Forge gives you a choice, whether to do this at all for both low and
 high frequencies and even lets you set them but doesn't provide any time
 parameters. Professional Reverb hardware such as Lexicon PCM 70,80&90 let you
 you control frequency and time of this, for low and high frequencies.
</P>
<P class=a>
 This can effectivly add to room's liveliness. A room full of people will
 absorb high frequencies a lot faster than an empty room, in which only the
 materials would make the difference, so in Cool Edit we'll set the 'High
 Frequency Absorbtion Time' very low, since we're in a crowded club.
 For Soundforge activate the 'Attenuate high frequencies above' box and set
 the frequency parameter to around 2000-2500 Hz. Experiment a bit. The higher
 this frequeny and the longer the Absorbtion Time parameter in Cool Edit,
 the emptier and and colder your room will seem. In small rooms this can
 cause the room to sound very metallic. Sewer pipes and oil pipelines e.g.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The last thing you have to do is set the balance between the WET signal
 and your original DRY signal. Here you can do as you please but remember
 that only very smoothed hard surfaces in big cavernous space create very loud
 reverbs. A church might do that if there aren't a big number of people and
 wooden benches in there, but a club doesn't :).
</P>
<P class=a>
 So when you create your next 'soon-to-be-the-hit-of-Hornet' module, be sure
 to check the possibilities of adding dimension and scope to your song.
 Put your snare to the front, the piano a little to the back, and the sax
 just a little in front of the drums. Experiment. With these basics you'll
 be able to get better results in less time.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Btw, Snare always gets reverb. How much and what kind up to you, but it's a
 generaly good thing. It's also important to decide whether you're trying to
 simulate a real live band or doint a multitrack sound, which boasts all kinds
 of nice ideas, like doubling(another take of the same thing on top of the
 first take), extreme panning and in general NOT reality :).
