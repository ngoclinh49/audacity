<p class=qr>Introducing ...</p>

<p class=a>
<font color="#000099">Audacity</font>, a free cross platform audio editor.
</p>
<p class=a>
  For new users to Audacity,
  see <a href="tutorial_basics_1.html">the Tutorial in four parts</a> for
  some basics on digital audio, setting up Audacity, as well as information on
  playback and your first recording.
</p>

<p class=a><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is currently in version 1.0.0.
This is a stable release of Audacity; it has been tested and works well for most people.
However, it comes with no guarantee, and we depend on your feedback in order to continue
to improve on it.  Please check our website for the latest version, including a
beta-quality preview of the next version under development.

  <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a collaborative project,
so there are lots of opportunities for you to get involved if you're interested!

<p class=qr>What can you do with <font color="#000099">Audacity</font>?</p>
<p class=a><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a program that manipulates digital audio
  waveforms. In addition to recording sounds directly from
  within the program, it imports many sound file formats, including
  <a href="fileformats.html#wav">WAV</a>,
  <a href="fileformats.html#aiff">AIFF</a>,
  <a href="fileformats.html#au">AU</a>,
  <a href="fileformats.html#ircam">IRCAM</a>,
  <a href="fileformats.html#mp3">MP3</a>, and
  <a href="fileformats.html#ogg">Ogg Vorbis</a>.</p>
<p class=a>
  It supports all common editing
  operations such as Cut, Copy, and Paste, plus it will mix tracks and
  apply plug-in effects to any part of a sound. It also has a
  built-in amplitude envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode
  and a frequency analysis window for audio analysis applications.

What can't <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> do?
</p>

<p class=a>
  Although <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a very powerful
  audio editor that works with an unlimited number tracks of virtually
  unlimited size, it cannot do everything. It cannot :

<ul>
	<li>Record more than two channels at once.  It does
	not support any special hardware, but just works with the system's
	default audio device.

	<li>Resample audio to different sample rates (this is available in version 1.1 and later).

	<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> opens MIDI files,
	but it is not a MIDI editor, and its
	MIDI features are extremely limited.

	<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> currently only
	works with 16-bit quality audio
   (version 1.1 supports 32-bit audio).
</ul>

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
	  <td width="50%" valign=top>

<p class=a>Audacity works with tracks, that contain one audio file.
This file is editable and all actions are undoable.  Undo's are instantaneous.</p>
<p class=a>Almost anything is undoable, including importing and deleting tracks!
<p class=a>There are no inserts, auxes or buses yet.</p>
<p class=a>The Windows and Mac versions can use VST plugins, but
there is no preview function available yet.</a>

<p class=a>There is one master gain control in the <a href="toolbar.html">toolbar</a>.</p>
<p class=a>There is volume automation via the <a href="toobar.html#envelope">envelope tool</a>.</p>
<p class=a><B>Solo</b> does not switch off <b>Mute</b></p>
<p class=a>Editing functions include <a href="menu_edit.html">Cut, Copy, Paste</a>,<a href="menu_edit.html#duplicate">Duplicate</a>(to new track at same timecode), <a href="menu_edit.html#split">Split</a>(to new track at same timecode), <a href="menu_edit.html#silence">Silence</a> and <a href="menu_edit.html#insertsilence">Insert Silence</a>.</p>

<p class=qr>What makes Audacity unique?</p>

<ul>
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
	is <it>free</it> and the source code is available
    under the GNU General Public License.
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
    is <it>cross-platform</it> - it runs on Windows (98 through XP),
    Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and many Unix platforms, including Linux.
<li>No limits on the number of tracks or the length of any track,
    except the size of your hard disk.

<li>Import almost anything: WAV, AIFF, Next/AU, IRCAM, MP3, and
	MIDI files are supported natively, but
	<font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
	will also open just about any uncompressed sound file and
	automatically deduce the format (using the
	<a href="menu_project.html#importraw">Import Raw Data...</a>
	feature).
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
    not only includes many high-quality effects built-in, but also
    lets you use plug-in effects in the industry-standard VST format.
    There are dozens of free, shareware, and commercial VST
    plug-ins online that do everything from Reverb to
    Noise Reduction.
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
	acts like a <it>non-destructive editor</it>, providing
	multiple levels of undo, but it also writes changes made to the
	audio to disk, eliminating the need for complicated real-time
	processing.
<li>Label tracks allow you to annotate waveforms (for example,
    transcribing speech) and later export the waveforms to a text file.
<li>Powerful spectral features allow you to view waveforms as
    spectrograms or plot the power spectrum of any region of audio,
    and even export this data to a spreadsheet.
</ul>
