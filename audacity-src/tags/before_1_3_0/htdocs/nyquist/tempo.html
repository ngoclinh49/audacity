* Tempo Change
<p>
I want to convert old tapes recorded at half speed to normal speed
using Audacity, and  wanted a simple plug-in to change tempo.
<p>
Variables
<p>
1. Tempo change: default is 0.5.<br>
2. Multiply or divide selector: 0=multiply, 1=divide; default is 0.
<p>
If multiply is selected, tempo of the audio is multiplied by the
tempo change number. Selecting divide divides the tempo by the
tempo change number.
<p>
Applying this effect to selected audio (using default settings)
halves the tempo (and therefore the pitch).
<p>
Multiplying by 0.5 is the same as dividing by 2.
<p>
Audio examples
<p>
tempo1.mp3: "Hello" at half, normal and twice normal speeds.
