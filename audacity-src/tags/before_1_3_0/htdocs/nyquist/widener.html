* Stereo Widener
<p>
This plug-in gives the effect of widening stereo audio, using a
method David Walsh outlined on the Audacity-users list (thanks
David).
<p>
There is one variable, Inverted Signal Volume (vol, default is -20
db).
<p>
Each channel is inverted, attenuated by (vol), then added to  the
opposite channel. The greater (vol) is, the wider the stereo effect.
