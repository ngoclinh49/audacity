* Extract Audio (percent)
<p>
Select all your audio, then use this plug-in to set the start and
end margins using percentages. Start and end margins are anywhere
from 0 to 100 percent.
<p>
If for example your audio is ten seconds long, you set the start at
0 percent and the end at 50 percent, the result will be the first
5 seconds of your selected audio. If you re-apply the effect with
the same settings, the result will be the first 2.5 seconds of your
original selected audio.
<p>
If you do not like the extracted audio margins, you can undo the
result and apply with slightly different settings. Or you can re-
apply for shrinking the audio further. Great for people who do not
want to fiddle around with the cursor keys for selecting audio.
<p>
Beware! Audio outside the start and end percent margins will be
discarded! A plug-in for re-inserting the (altered) extracted audio
into the discarded audio is in the works.
