<p><strong>15 Band Equalizer:</strong></p>
<p>This effect can equalize more than one band at the same time</p>
<p>You have 15, to choose and you can manipulate whole of them moving their sliders </p>
<p>There are also two clips: </p>
<p>The first one is a phrase two times, with no changes and with the five lowest bands raised 10 db</p>
<p>The second one is the same but here the bands wich are raised 10 db are the highest five ones</p>
