The name 'comb' filter comes from how it acts on the audio spectrum
of what it's applied to: it looks like a comb with the teeth
pointing up. For example, if you set the comb frequency at 1000 Hz,
the comb filter emphasizes 1000 Hz as well as 2000, 3000, 4000 and
so on Hz. This particular plug-in produces an 'airy' effect, which
is more pronounced the higher the comb decay value is set, and
resonance is increasingly produced as well.

A comb filter can be produced using flanger-like settings on a
delay effect, but this filter does not use a delay to get the
result, so it does sound somewhat different.
