Variable Duration Silence Generator
<p>
This plug-in will generate any length of silence from 0.000 to
60.999 seconds. I wanted it so that I could add a specific length
of time after a sound (such as Steven Jones' Risset Drum), in order
to repeat the audio for a rhythmic effect.
<p>
there are two edit fields: one for thousandths (1/1000) of a second (0.000
to 0.999 seconds), and the other for whole seconds (0 to 60), for 0.000 to
60.999 seconds.
<p>
Copy the file into your audacity plug-ins folder. Next time you
open Audacity, Variable Duration Silence Generator will be in the
generate menu.
