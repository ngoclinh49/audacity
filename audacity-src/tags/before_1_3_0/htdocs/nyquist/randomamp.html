Random amplitude modulation
<p>
Similar to Random Panning, this time playing around with the volume
knob. You can set the maximum speed (maxspeed, in hz) of the random
changes. The other setting, factor, determines how deeply the
random amp effect is. Because of the way the random signal is
generated, the lower maxspeed is, the higher factor must be in
order to produce the same amp result. (Factor can be used to
increase or decrease the amp effect.)
