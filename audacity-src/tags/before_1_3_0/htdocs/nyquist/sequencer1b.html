* sequencer1b.ny: Audio Sample Sequencer 1.b
<p>
Improved over sequencer 1.a: simplified code makes this a version
1 plug-in. Sequences mono and stereo audio already loaded into
Audacity, whether a note, vocal sound, series of notes and/or vocal
sounds, etc.  
<p>
Select all audio first, then click on Audio Sample Sequencer 1.b
from the effects menu.
<p>
Variables:
<p>
tempo (steady, in beats per minute);
<p>
beats per measure (one to sixteen). This plug-in "assumes" that one
sequence of notes is one measure;
<p>
sequences to generate: how many of these sequences do you want to
generate (from one to a thousand);
<p>
16 pairs of tone shift and volume level (tone shift is measured in
semitones - 0 means no tone shift, negative numbers indicate tone
drop, positive numbers indicate tone increase; volume level 1.0
means regular volume, 0.0 means you do not hear a note generated
for that beat. volume can range from 0.0 to 1.0.)
<p>
When you have a tone loaded into Audacity, you can create a major
scale of 8 notes by 1. selecting desired tempo; 2. selecting 8
beats per measure; 3. selecting how many sets
(sequences) of these 8 notes you want to generate (default is 16). 
These would be the settings for the 8 tone shift edit fields:
<p>
0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12.
<p>
If you start with a C note, the above settings will generate a C
major scale. If your starting note is a B flat note, the above will
create a B flat major scale.
<p>
Rhythms can also be created by playing with the volume edit fields.
For example, in a series of eighth notes, notes which fall on only
the first, fourth and seventh beats can be made by making beats per
measure 8, and making volume on #2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 to 0.0.
<p>
It is possible to generate a short sequence using this plug-in,
then apply it again to that new audio with different settings.
<p>
Copy sequencer1b.ny into your Audacity plug-ins folder. The next
time you open Audacity, you'll find audio Sample Sequencer 1.b in
the effects menu.
