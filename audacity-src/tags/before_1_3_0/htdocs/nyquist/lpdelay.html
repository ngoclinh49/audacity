Low-pass delay
<p>
You can define delay time, how much each delay
decreases in db (although this does not seem to be necessary, so
the default value is 0 db),  number of delays, the starting cutoff
frequency of the low pass filter, and how much to decrease the
cutoff frequency (in octaves) from there for each delay.
<p>
To me, this has the psychoacoustic effect of each delay sounding
further and further away.

Based on an effect heard in a popular Cher tune in the late 1990s
or later. Thanks for the idea Cher!
