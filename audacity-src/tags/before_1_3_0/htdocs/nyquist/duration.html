* Selection Duration (Version 2 plug-in)
<p>
Once copied into your Audacity plug-ins folder, this plug-in
utility appears in the analyze menu. It gives the duration of audio
you have selected. A lot easier to use for people using a screen
reader (rather than trying to decipher those numbers on the
screen).
<p>
If you have opened or imported more than one track and have not yet
done a Quick Mix, this plug-in sequentially gives the duration of
each track you loaded into Audacity. Simply press &lt;enter&gt;
after each track duration is given. The final screen gives
information from Nyquist, which you can ignore. Simply press
&lt;enter&gt; to get to the regular Audacity screen.
<p>
This is a Nyquist Version 2 plug-in which works in Audacity 1.2.3
and later.

Written by David R. Sky with Nyquist pointers from Steven Jones and
Dominic Mazzoni.
