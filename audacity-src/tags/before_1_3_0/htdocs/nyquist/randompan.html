Random Panning
<p>
Like someone is playing around with the panning knob. You can set
the maximum speed (maxspeed, in hz) of the random changes. The
other setting, factor, determines how deeply the random panning
effect is. Because of the way the random signal is generated, the
lower maxspeed is, the higher factor must be in order to produce
the same panning result. (Factor can be used to increase or
decrease the panning effect.)
