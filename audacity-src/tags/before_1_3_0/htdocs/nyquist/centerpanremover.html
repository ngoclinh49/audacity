* Center pan Remover (often called Vocal Remover)
<p>
For removing vocals which are panned to center, you can invert one
channel then pan both channels to center. Audio which is common to
both channels then disappears. this often removes other audio such
as drums, which are also often panned to center.
<p>
With centerpanremover.ny, you can select whether to invert one
channel, or to invert a range of frequencies in one channel, before
panning both channels to center.
<p>
Variables
<p>
1. Select whether to invert one channel or a band of frequencies.
<p>
2. If frequency band is selected, "remove frequencies above..." is
default 500Hz.
<p>
3. If frequency band is selected, "remove frequencies below..." is
default 2000Hz. 
<p>
In other words, with the default settings, a two-octave range from
500Hz to 2000Hz (2 kilohertz) is removed.
<p>
Audio that isn't exactly panned to center is louder in one channel
than in the other. Thus, the further from the center pan position,
the louder that audio will be in the result.
