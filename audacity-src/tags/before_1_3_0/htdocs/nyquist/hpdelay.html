High-pass Delay
<p>
You can define delay time, how much each delay
decreases in db (although this does not seem to be necessary, so
the default value is 0 db),  number of delays, the starting cutoff
frequency of the high pass filter, and how much to increase the
cutoff frequency (in octaves) from there for each delay.

Applied to a voice, each delay sounds like it's increasingly coming
from a telephone.
