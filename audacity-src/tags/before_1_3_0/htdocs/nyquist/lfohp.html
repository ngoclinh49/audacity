* LFO High Pass Filter
<p>
Similar to the LFO Low pass Filter, except a low frequency
oscillator moves the cutoff frequency of a highpass filter up and
down.  
<p> 
Variables
<p>
1. Center cutoff frequency, in Hz (default 640Hz).<br>
2. LFO depth: how far above and below the center frequency the LFO
sweeps the filter (in octaves, default 1.0).<br>
3. LFO frequency: speed of up and down sweeping (default
0.2Hz).<br>
4. LFO starting phase: in degrees, from -180 to +180 (default 0).
<p>
Audio examples
<p>
lfolp1.mp3: center frequency 640Hz, 5 octave depth, LFO 1.0Hz,
applied to 110Hz square wave.<br>
lfolp2.mp3: 640Hz center frequency, 5 octave depth, 5Hz LFO,
applied 3 times to voice.
