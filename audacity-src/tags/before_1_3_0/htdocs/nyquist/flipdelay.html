* Delay with Stereo Flip
<p>
This is a stereo delay effect: with each delay, the stereo channels
are flipped left-right and vice versa. Inspired by a sound effect
heard in the opening track of Mike Oldfield's "songs From Distant
Earth."
<p>
Variables:
<p>
decay: the drop in volume (db) with each delay (default 3.0);
<p>
delay time: default 0.5 seconds;
<p>
number of delays, including the original audio: default 10.
<p>
Thanks to Steven Jones for illustrating how to check for even/odd
numbers.
