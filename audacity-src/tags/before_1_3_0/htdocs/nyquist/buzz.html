Buzz tone generator
<p>
Generates a nasal-sounding tone composed of the base frequency plus
n-1 harmonics. If for example you choose a frequency of 100 hz with
4 harmonics, this plug-in will generate a tone comprised of 100,
200, 300 and 400 Hz, of equal amplitude. (The more harmonics, the
more nasal and high-pitched the tone sounds.) Although the original
Nyquist code asks for a MIDI note number rather than a frequency,
this plug-in allows you to choose between the frequency (e.g. 440
Hz) and the MIDI note number (57). (0=frequency, 1=MIDI note
number.) You may choose the number of harmonics, tone and appended
silence duration. Thanks to Jacques guignot for curiosity about
this Nyquist tone generator, and Dominic mazzoni's patch of the
original Nyquist code.
