Risset Drum generator
<p>
The Risset-drum is based on the pioneering work of Jean Claude Risset in
the mid 1960's. It produces a realistic drum sound consisting of three
components; a sine wave ring-modulated by narrow band noise, an
enharmonic tone, and a relatively strong sine wave at the fundamental.
