* tuningfork.ny: Tuning Fork
<p>
In preparing to do some vocal work with Audacity, I realized I
wanted a software tuning fork.
<p>
After you have copied tuningfork.ny into your Audacity plug-ins
folder and restarted Audacity, Tuning Fork is in the generate menu.
After you click on it, a brief table outlining C notes and their
equivalent MIDI note numbers appears near the top of the screen.
C0=0 C1=12 C2=24 and so on.
<p>
Variables:
<p>
Tone duration: up to 120 seconds.
<p>
Constant or fade out (0=constant 1=fade out, default=0 constant):
Choose whether you want the tone to remain at constant volume or
fade out during the duration.
<p>
MIDI or frequency (0=MIDI 1=frequency, default=0 MIDI):
Choose whether to generate a MIDI note number or frequency.
A440=MIDI note 69, middle C=60.
<p>
MIDI note: if you have chosen to generate a MIDI note, enter the
note number here. Note that you can use non-integers here (such as
60.75)
<p>
Frequency: If you have chosen to generate a frequency, enter the
frequency here.
