* chimesdelay.ny: Chimes Delay
(Version 2 plug-in, works in Audacity 1.2.3 and later)
<p>
1. Adds random delay to your audio. You can specify the maximum
delay of the random delays (default 10 seconds, maximum 120
seconds) and how many random delays within that max delay time
(default 20 delays, maximum 100).
<p>
2. Using the minimum volume field, you can specify the lowest
random volume that each random delay can have (default is 50
percent, range between 0 and 100 percent).
<p>
3. This plug-in also randomly changes the pitch of each random
delay. You can specify a note list (which is where the name 'Chimes
Delay' comes from). the following is the default note list:
<p>
-24 -12 -5 0 4 7 12 14 19
<p>
Each number indicates how many semitones your audio could be pitch
shifted (along with matching tempo shift). For example, 0 indicates
no pitch shift, 12 indicates rise of 12 semitones (one octave), -5
indicates drop of 5 semitones (like going from C down to G below
that C note).
<p>
If the audio you have loaded into Audacity is C3, the above note
list would produce the following notes randomly:
<p>
C1 C2 G2 C3 E3 G3 C4 D4 G4
<p>
A distinctly major-sounding scale.
<p>
If you have a note list specified, this plug-in will randomly
choose from that list of notes for pitch and tempo shifting of each
random delay.
<p>
4. However, you can delete this note list, in which case a list of
notes will be generated between a lower and upper number. The
default values of these two numbers are -12 semitones (decrease of
1 octave) and +24 semitones (increase of 2 octaves), respectively. 
<p>
5. If your audio is in stereo, each random delay with random volume
and random pitch change will also be randomly panned anywhere
between left and right. (It is best that your audio is first panned
to center before applying Chimes Delay.)
<p>
6. Additional notes:
<p>
Adding a bit of regular delay and/or other effects before applying
Chimes Delay results in a richer sound.
<p>
If you want a particular note (from the note list) to be repeated
more often, you can enter it more than once in the list.
<p>
If you simply want your audio randomly delayed with no multiple
pitch changes, either enter just one number into the note list, or
enter the same number into the min and max notes fields.
<p>
If you want no random amplitude changes, make the amplitude field
100 percent.
<p>
It is possible that total length of your resulting audio will be
max delay _plus_ duration of your original audio. This may be still
longer if the final delay(s) is/are decreased in pitch (resulting
in a reduced tempo).
<p>
If your original audio is non-musical, chimesdelay.ny will not make
it musical.
<p>
Many thanks to Steven Jones! - his cool 'Harmonic Noise' generator
plug-in is the source for Nyquist code to handle a string-input
note list. Thanks Steven for additional list help as well.
