* turntablewarp-ms.ny: Turntable Warping (mono/stereo) <br>
(version 2 plug-in)
<p>
Improved over the previous turntablewarp.ny plug-in - you can warp
both mono and stereo audio. 
<p>
You can simulate unplugging your turntable while it's playing,
plugging it in, and related effects. A version 2 Nyquist plug-in
which works on Audacity 1.2.3 and later.
<p>
Variables with explanations:
<p>
"step" indicates how many semitones above or below pitch of
original audio (1 step = 1 semitone, 12 steps = 1 octave, etc.);
<p>
"amplitude" indicates volume level (in percent).
<p>
There are 5 values you can change:
<p>
1. start step (default 0): how many semitones above or below
original audio at start of selection;
<p>
2. start amplitude (default 100%): volume at start of selection;
<p>
3. change time (default 50%): point in time of original selection
at which warping values can change between first and second part of
selection. This point has an internal step value of 0 semitones
change, and internal volume of 100%;
<p>
4. end step (default -12 semitones, 1 octave drop): at end of
warped selection, how many semitones audio has been warped;
<p>
5. end volume (default 40%): volume at end of warped audio.
<p>
Applying this plug-in with the default settings results in the
audio starting to slow down halfway through the original selection,
and dropping to 40% of original volume. Like unplugging a turntable
while it's playing.
<p>
Since the "change time" is internally set at step 0 semitones and
volume 100%, different warping effects can be created, depending on
the start and end step and volume values: 
<p>
slowing down then speeding up;<br>
speeding up then slowing down;<br>
speeding up to a particular step value then remaining at that
value;<br>
slowly speeding up then quickly speeding up;<br>
etc.
<p>
Thanks to Roger B. Dannenberg for the warp tutorial on which this
plug-in is based. Thanks Sebastien Chopin for the request for the
stereo version of this plug-in.
<p>
Copy turntablewarp-ms.ny into the Audacity plug-ins folder. next
time you (re)start Audacity, Turntable Warping (mono/stereo) (V2)
will appear in the effects menu.
