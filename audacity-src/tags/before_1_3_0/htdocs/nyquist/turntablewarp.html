* turntablewarp.ny: Turntable Warping (version 2 plug-in)
<p>
You can simulate unplugging your turntable while it's playing,
plugging it in, and related effects. At this point only works on
mono audio. A version 2 Nyquist plug-in which works on Audacity
1.2.3 and later.
<p>
Variables with explanations:
<p>
&quot;step&quot; indicates how many semitones above or below pitch
of original audio (6 steps = half an octave, 12 steps = 1 octave,
etc.);
<p>
&quot;amplitude&quot; indicates volume level (in percent).
<p>
There are 5 values you can change:
<p>
1. start step (default 0): how many semitones above or below
original audio at start of selection;
<p>
2. start amplitude (default 100%): volume at start of selection;
<p>
3. change time (default 50%): point in time of original selection
at which warping values can change between first and second part of
selection. This point has an internal step value of 0 and internal
volume of 100%;
<p>
4. end step (default -12): at end of warped selection, how many
semitones audio has been warped;
<p>
5. end volume (default 40%): volume at end of warped audio.
<p>
Applying this plug-in with the default settings results in the
audio starting to slow down halfway through the original selection,
and dropping to 40% of original volume. Like unplugging a turntable
while it's playing.
<p>
Since the &quot;change time&quot; is internally set at step 0 and
volume 100%, different warping effects can be created, depending on
the start and end step and volume values: 
<p>
slowing down then speeding up;
speeding up then slowing down;
speeding up then remaining normal;
slowly speeding up then quickly speeding up;
etc.
<p>
Thanks to Roger B. Dannenberg for the warp tutorial on which this
plug-in is based.
