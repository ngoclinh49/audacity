* Time Shift Tool
<p>
A plug-in for performing the same task as the time shift tool in
Audacity.
<p>
Choose the track you want to time shift (0=left, 1=right), and the
amount to shift (range from 0.0 to 100.0 milliseconds). If you
choose the left channel shifted by 10.0ms, it will start 10.0ms
later than previously.
<p>
Only works on stereo audio. Useful for aligning tracks due to
recording latency. Also can be used for stereo effects.
