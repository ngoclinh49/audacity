Stereo Butterfly (static)
<p>
The name comes from a butterfly's wings, which can be spread wide
(1, full stereo), closed (0, sounding mono), or somewhere in-
between. Stereo butterfly can even mirror the left and right
channels (-1... the butterfly's flipped!). And also anywhere
between the extremes from -1 to 1.
