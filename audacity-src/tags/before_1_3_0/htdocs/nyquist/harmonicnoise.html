harmonicnoise generates sounds by mixing narrow bands of noise. The center
frequency of each band is harmonically related to the fundamental and the
amplitude decrease inversely with the harmonic number. Depending on the band
width the result sound ranges from very noise to tonal with a heavy chorusing like
effect. 
<p>CONTROLS:
<P><B>MIDI Note List: </B> A list of MIDI notes to be produced. Each note must
      be separated by at least one space and punctuation is not allowed.
      Notes are specified either by an integer or by a Nyquist mnemonic. 
<p><B>Number of Harmonics: </B> An integer between 1 and 32 which sets the
      number of partials for each note generated.
<p><B>Duration: </B> The tones duration in seconds.
<P><B>Band Width: </B> The noise band width in Hertz. Higher values result in a
      more noisy tone. 
<P><B>Odd Harmonics Only: </B> Choose between all harmonics or odd numbered
      harmonics only.
