Audacity is built upon other free libraries; some of
these libraries may have come with Audacity in the lib-src
directory.  Others you are expected to install first if
you want Audacity to have certain capabilities.  Most
of these libraries are not distributed under the terms
of the GPL, but rather some other free, GPL-compatible
license.  Specifically:

  wxWindows: LGPL
    Cross-platform GUI library - must be downloaded and
    compiled separately.

  expat: BSD-like license.
    Provides XML parsing.  Included with Audacity

  iAVC: LGPL
    Part of the code to the AVC Compressor effect.
    Included with Audacity.

  libid3tag: GPL
    Reads/writes ID3 tags in MP3 files.  Optional
    separate download as part of libmad.

  libmad: GPL
    Decodes MP3 files.  Optional separate download.

  libnyquist: BSD-like license.
    Functional language for manipulating audio; available
    within Audacity for effects processing.

  libogg: BSD-like license.
    Optional separate download, along with libvorbis.

  libsndfile: LGPL
    Reads and writes uncompressed PCM audio files.
    Included with Audacity.

Compilation instructions:

First you must download wxWindows from:

  http://www.wxwindows.org/

If you install the RPM, make sure you install the devel RPM
as well, otherwise, you won't be able to compile Audacity
from source.

To compile on Linux, Mac OS X, and other Unix systems,
simply execute these commands:

  ./configure
  make
  make install  # as root

To see compile-time options you can set, you can type
"./configure --help".
  
If you want to do any development, you might want to generate
a configure cache and header dependencies:

  ./configure -C
  make dep

To compile on Windows using MSVC++, please follow the
instructions found in compile.txt in the "win" subdirectory.

For more information on compilation (CodeWarrior for Mac is
also supported) please email audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net

-------------------------------------------------------------

Known issues/problems:

  * The user's manual is still under construction.  Updates for
    Audacity 1.2 are about 75% complete.  There may be some missing
    or incomplete pages.

  * Audacity may crash if audio is edited while the program is
    playing or recording.

  * (MacOS X only?) If you select Quit, but then cancel the Quit operation,
    then the Quit and Preferences commands stop working.

  * Some imported MP3 files may have pops or clicks caused by clipping.

  * The volume sliders in the mixer toolbar may reset the volume whenever
    the program starts, on some systems.

  * Audacity can import and display MIDI files, but they cannot be played
    or edited.

  * Audacity crashes when trying to convert to a sample rate more than 12
    times faster or slower than the original rate.

  * Recording in full duplex (play existing tracks while recording) on some
    Linux systems causes the recording to sound slowed-down.

  * MacOS X only:  The Find Zero Crossings command has "Command-Z" listed as
    the shortcut, but the actual shortcut is "Z".  The shortcuts for "Online
    Help" and "Open" conflict.

  * MacOS X only: For audio with zero amplitude, Audacity may display nothing
    (instead of thin straight line).

-------------------------------------------------------------

New features in Audacity 1.2.0:
  * User Interface
    - Vertical zooming of tracks.
    - Improved look and placement of toolbars.
    - New custom mouse cursors.
    - Complete implementation of editable keyboard shortcuts.
    - Find zero-crossings.
    - Mouse wheel can be used to zoom in and out.
    - Multi-Tool mode.
    - Amplify using envelope.
    - Labels can store selections (like Audacity 1.0.0).

  * Effects
    - Repeat Last Effect command
    - Improved VST plug-in support
    - Most effects now have a Preview button
    - Compressor (Dynamic Range Compressor)
    - Change Pitch (without changing tempo)
    - Change Tempo (without changing pitch)
    - Change Speed (changing both pitch and tempo)
    - Repeat (useful for creating loops)
    - Normalize (adjust volume and DC bias)

  * Audio I/O
    - 1-second preview command.
    - Looped play.

  * File I/O
    - Audacity 1.2.0 opens project files from all previous versions
      of Audacity from 0.98 through 1.1.3.
    - Open multiple files from the same dialog.
    - Use a text file to specify a list of audio files to open with offsets.

  * Updated user manual

  * Bug fixes
    - Project files with special characters are no longer invalid.
    - "Scratchy" noises caused by bad clipping are fixed.
    - Audacity no longer exports invalid Ogg files, and does not cut off the
      last few seconds of exported Ogg files.
    - Mono MP3 files now export at the correct speed.
    - Many incorrect results from the Envelope tool have been fixed.
    - The "Export Labels" command now overwrites existing files correctly.
    - The "Plot Spectrum" window displays the correct octave numbers for
      notes.
    - Several memory leaks are fixed.

New features in Audacity 1.1.3:
  * User Interface
    - New Mixer toolbar allows you to control the output
      volume, input volume, and input source directly
      from Audacity.
    - Every track now has its own gain and pan controls.

  * File I/O
    - Uses improved project file format.  (Unfortunately reading
      previous formats, including 1.1.1, is not supported.)
    - Block files (stored in Audacity project directories) now
      use the standard AU format.  Though some Audacity
      meta-information is in these files, they can now be
      read by many other popular audio programs as well.
    - Fixed some bugs relating to reading/writing audio
      files with more than 16 bits per sample.
    - Import RAW is functional again, with a simpler GUI
      but support for far more file formats.  The
      autodetection algorithms are much more accurate than
      in 1.0.

  * Audio I/O
    - Completely rewritten audio I/O, with lower latency
      and minimal chance of buffer underruns while
      recording.

  * Resampling
    - Using high quality resampling algorithms, with the
      option of better quality for mixing than for real-time
      playback

    - Preliminary support for Time Tracks, for changing
      playback speed over time.

  * Many more bug fixes and new features

      in the "Plug-ins" folder, relative to the program.
    - On Unix, Audacity looks for translations in
      <prefix>/share/locale and looks for everything else
