In this directory is nearly verbatim source code from the libmpeg3 project.
It can be downloaded in full from
http://heroines.sourceforge.net/libmpeg3.php3.

The only change that has been made is the removal of the deCSS code, which
would otherwise reside in mpeg3css.c. However, it has been replaced with a
stub file. Therefore as distributed this directory contains NO deCSS code!
