<p>

Save an empty project. Or simply use the one from the
<a href="tutorial_setup.htm">previous part</a>.
Remember, that if you don't save your project before you start
recording or importing, that all recordings, edit and other files
will be written to the temporary directory (folder) set in the
<i>Directories</i> preferences (though you can always select
"Save As..." later).

<p>

<table cellpadding=6><tr><td bgcolor="#d0ffd0" align="center">
<font size="+1">2. Check the preferences</font>
</td></tr></table>

<p>

Make sure your playback and recording device are set.
If you're going to record a stereo signal, check
the &quot;Record in stereo&quot; checkbox in the
<i>Audio I/O</i> preferences.

<p>

When picking a device to record from, make sure you've set up all the connections properly, such as pluging a microphone in to the <B>Mic Input</B>, and any other device in to the <B>Line In</B> of your sound card. Then check that the gain level  knob(the amount by how much the input should be amplified) of the mixer of your soundcard is set right.

<p>

Since most soundcards can mix the inputs back in to the outputs,
the easiest way to test your microphone is to speak in to it while
playing with your soundcard mixer. The soundcard mixer is a software
either provided by the soundcard maker, or by the operating system
you're using. The Windows mixer is pretty straightforward, though
some soundcards bring their own along.  On the MacOS, use the
Sound Control Panel.
Linux users probably have heaploads of
mixer applications at their disposal.
Just make sure they work before yelling at your screen that nothing works.

<p>

<table cellpadding=6><tr><td bgcolor="#d0ffd0" align="center">

<p>

Click on the red Record button and click on the yellow
Stop button to cease recording.
<p>


<p>

That's it. You can now play around with your recording
and explore the editing capabilities of Audacity.
Remember that you can use the Undo function almost without limits.
