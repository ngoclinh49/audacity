Part 5 - Common Editing Tasks

</h1></center>



This page will give you an idea of some of the possible

things you can do with Audacity and walk you through the process.



<p>



<a href="#tour1">1. Splitting an MP3 into two separate files</a>



<p>



<a href="#tour2">2. Mixing background music with a voiceover</a>



<p>



<a href="#tour3">3. Recording harmonies with yourself</a>

</td></tr></table>



<p>(Before you try to export MP3 files, read the section on

  <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a> for some

  important information on steps you need to do first.)



<p>



<ul>

<li>Open the MP3 file.

<li>Select the part of it that you want to be the first file.

    Listen to it by clicking the Play button.

<li>While this part is selected, choose

    Export Selection as MP3... from the File menu.

<li>Now select the part you want to be the other song and

    Export again.

</ul>

<table cellpadding=6><tr><td bgcolor="#ffd060" align="center">

<font size="+1">Mixing background music with a voiceover</font>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Audacity makes it very easy to mix two different sounds together.

<p>

<ul>

<li>Open one sound (for example, the background music).

<li>Select Import Audio... from the Project menu and open

    the other sound (for example, the voiceover).

<li>Listen to your sound using the Play button.  <b>Audacity</b>

    automatically mixes them together.

<li>Choose the <a href="toolbar.htm#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool

    and adjust the position of one track or the other until

    they're synchronized the way you want them.

    You can even move tracks around while they're playing.

<li>If you hear clipping which wasn't present in either of the

    original files, it means that the combined volume of the two

    tracks is too loud.  Select one or both of the tracks and

    then use the Amplify... effect to reduce the volumes until

    you don't hear clipping anymore.

<li>Export as a WAV or MP3 file.

</ul>

<table cellpadding=6><tr><td bgcolor="#ffd060" align="center">

<font size="+1">Recording harmonies with yourself</font>

</td></tr></table>



<p>

<ul>

  <li>Open the Preferences, click on the Audio I/O tab, and

      check the box marked "Play other tracks while recording new one".



  <li>Click the Record button.  Record yourself singing.  Click Stop.



  <li>Click the Record button again.

    The first track you recorded will play, but <b>Audacity</b>

    will also record a new track at the same time, allowing

    you to sing harmony with yourself.



  <li>When you play the two tracks you recorded

    together, they probably won't be synchronized.

    This is normal and is not the

    fault of <b>Audacity</b>.  To fix it, you will need to grab the

    <a href="toolbar.htm#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool and slide one

    of the tracks around until it sounds right.    



</ul>
