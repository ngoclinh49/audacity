Recording digital audio is similar to taking a picture with a digital camera.

You take snapshots.



<p>



Let's examine the audio material on an audio CD

<i>(also called CDDA-Compact Disc Digital Audio)</i>.

<p>



Here we find two channels (left and right) of 44100 snapshots per second.

These snapshots are called samples and in this case are stored as

Pulse Code Modulation data (PCM).  The important thing to know

about PCM is that it's the closest thing a digital device can come

to the actual audio signal.  Your computer has many other ways of

storing audio, but PCM is the only one that encodes raw, 

uncompressed, audio.  Two common audio file formats, WAV and AIFF,

store PCM data.  To contrast, MP3 files do not store PCM data - 

they store compressed audio.



<p>



The number of samples taken per second is called

the sample rate.  In general, the higher the sample rate, the

higher the quality of the audio.  The sample rate of a CD

(44100 Hz, or 44100 samples per second) is good enough to

reproduce most sounds on all but the best speaker systems.

Some audiophiles prefer sounds recorded at 96000 Hz or higher.



<p>



Each sample on an audio CD is represented by a 16-bit number.

16 bits means that each sample can take on any of 2^16 different values.

It is also possible to store audio using 8 bits or 24 bits.

Just like with the sample rate, the audio quality goes up with

the number of bits.  Audacity currently only supports 16-bit audio.

This is where a part of your soundcard comes in.

It is the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

<p>



It interprets an electrical signal and assigns an absolute value to it,

which it writes to memory, so that software can read and store it away

in further places, such as your RAM or hard disk. The chain of software

your audio data passes through may be<BR>

<p>



Playback of digital audio uses a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).

This takes the sample and sets a certain voltage on the analog outputs

to recreate the signal, that the Analog-to-Digital Converter originally

took to create the sample, as faithfully as possible. The first CD players

did only that and it sounded horrible.

Nowadays DACs use Oversampling to smooth out the audio signal.

The quality of the filters in the DAC also contribute to the quality

of the recreated analogue audio signal. The filter is part of a

multitude of stages that make up a DAC.
