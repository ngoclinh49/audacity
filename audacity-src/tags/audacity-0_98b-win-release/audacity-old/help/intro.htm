For new users to Audacity, see the

<a href="tutorial_audio.htm">the Tutorials</a> for

some basics on digital audio, setting up Audacity,

playback, recording, and some basic editing.



<p>



<font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is currently in version 0.98.

While it is very usable and has many useful features, it is still

in beta and is not quite finished yet. 



 Please email your bug reports to

<u>audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net</u>

and check the website frequently for new versions.

Version 1.0 may be available in the spring of 2002.



<font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a collaborative project,

so if you would like to get involved in any way, check the website

for opportunities!

<p><font size=+0><b>What can you do with <font color="#000099">Audacity</font>?</b></font>



<p><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

is a program that manipulates digital audio

waveforms. In addition to recording sounds directly from

within the program, it imports many sound file formats, including

  <a href="fileformats.htm#wav">WAV</a>,

  <a href="fileformats.htm#aiff">AIFF</a>,

  <a href="fileformats.htm#au">AU</a>,

  <a href="fileformats.htm#ircam">IRCAM</a>,

  <a href="fileformats.htm#mp3">MP3</a>, and

  <a href="fileformats.htm#ogg">Ogg Vorbis</a>.  



  It supports all common editing

  operations such as Cut, Copy, and Paste, plus it will mix tracks and

  apply plug-in effects to any part of a sound. It also has a

  built-in amplitude envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode

  and a frequency analysis window for audio analysis applications.



<p><font size=+0><b>What can't <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> do?</b></font>



<p>Although <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a very powerful

  audio editor that works with an unlimited number tracks of virtually

  unlimited size, it cannot do everything:



<ul>

	<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

	cannot record more than two channels at once.  It does

	not support any special hardware, but just works with the system's

	default audio device.



	<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> opens MIDI files,

	but it is not a MIDI editor, and its

	MIDI features are extremely limited.



	<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> cannot resample

	audio to different sample rates (yet).

	<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> currently only

	works with 16-bit quality audio (so far - 

	support for higher quality audio is planned).

</ul>
