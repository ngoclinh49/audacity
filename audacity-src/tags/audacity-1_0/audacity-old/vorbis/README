Ogg Vorbis Decoding Library
===========================

This directory contains the headers and Linux x86 static libraries for
libvorbis and libogg, libraries that allow Audacity to open and decode Ogg
Vorbis files. They are distributed under the terms of the LGPL, included in
this directory under the filename LICENSE. The source code for these
libraries can be downloaded from http://www.vorbis.com.

The configure script is set to use these libraries and headers only if
libvorbis and libogg are not already installed.
