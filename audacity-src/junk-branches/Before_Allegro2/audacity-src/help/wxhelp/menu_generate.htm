<p>Behaviour of Generate plug-ins is context sensitive:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you choose an item from the Generate menu when there are no tracks 
in a project, a new track is created. Otherwise, the current track is 
used.</li>

<li>If a track is selected and the cursor is placed in a single place in the 
track audio is inserted at the cursor position. The default duration is 30 
seconds. The audio created will replace the any selection, otherwise it is 
inserted into the track, shifting up later parts of the track.</li>

<li>If a region of audio is selected, audio is inserted at the left edge of 
the selection, and the length of the inserted audio is equal to the length 
of the selection. Changing length of inserted audio shrinks selection to fit 
new length.</li>
</ul>

Audacity always ships with three following plug-ins:

<p><b>Silence</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Inserts silence.</p>

<p><b>Tone...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Create a Sine wave, Square wave, or 
Sawtooth wave with user specified Frequency (Hz) and Amplitude (0-1).</p>

<p><b>White Noise...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Inserts random audio samples, which 
sounds like pure static.</p>

<p>
<hr width="50%">
</p>

<p>Any items which appear after these three built-ins are VST,
LADSPA, or Nyquist plug-ins.  It is possible for a poorly written
plug-in to crash Audacity, so always save your work before using a
plug-in.  Note that any effect that doesn't take any audio as input
will automatically be placed in the Generate menu.</p>
