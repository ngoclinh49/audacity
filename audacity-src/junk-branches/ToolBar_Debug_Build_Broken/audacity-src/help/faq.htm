1. Is Audacity really free?  Why?<br>
</b></font>

<p><font size=+0>Yes, in almost all senses.  Audacity is distributed under the
GPL license. For more details, see the LICENSE file included with Audacity.
Essentially it means that the program can be given or sold away for commercial
or personal purposes.  However, the source code must be available to anyone who
obtains a binary version, and any changes to the source code must also be
distributed under the GPL.
<br><br>Audacity requires wxWindows, which is distributed under a modified
version of the less-restrictive LGPL.  Please see the wxWindow web site for more
information - http://www.wxwindows.org.</font>

3. Windows: What do I do with the .exe file?<br>
</b></font>

<p><font size=+0>From the browser, select the option to "Run from current
location".  This launches the Audacity setup program, which will install the
Audacity program files and create an entry in the start menu.</font>

4. Windows: How do I uninstall Audacity?<br>
</b></font>

<p><font size=+0>Audacity can be uninstalled by openining Add/Remove Programs in
the Control Panel.  Select "Audacity" from the list and click the button
"Add/Remove".  This launches the Audacity uninstall program.

the .sit file?<br> </b></font>

6. Unix: Why do I get failed dependencies when installing from the RPM?
<br></b></font>

<p><font size=+0>First, ensure that the wxGTK is installed; a link can be found
from our Linux page - http://audacity.sourceforge.net/linux.html. If the RPM
still fails to install, this is an unresolved issue.  Simply install the RPM
using the flag --nodeps.</font>

7. Unix: Why do I get an error while loading
	the shared library libwx_gtk.so?<br></b></font>

<p><font size=+0>This could be one of two problems:
<br>- If you installed the wxWindows RPM, be sure to run "ldconfig" (as
root) so your system knows about the new library.

<br><br>- If you installed wxWindows
from source, it may have been installed in /usr/local, but /usr/local/lib may
not be in your library path. Add /usr/local/lib to the file "/etc/ld.so.conf"
and then run "ldconfig". You may also want to add "/usr/local/bin" to your path,
so that programs can find the "wx-config" utility.<br>
