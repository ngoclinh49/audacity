<a name="audioio"></a>

<p><b>Audio I/O</b>



<ul>

<li>The first control or set of controls in this pane is where you configure

which device <b>Audacity</b> should use for sound input and output.  For

example, some people might have two sound cards, and they want to select

which one to use.  Some computers have a built-in microphone, and this is

also where you'd select whether you want to record from there or from

the line-in jack on your sound card.  No need to adjust this if <b>Audacity</b>

is already playing to and recording from the correct place.<p>



<li><b>Record in Stereo</b>: If this is checked, recordings you make in

    Audacity will be stereo, otherwise they will be monaural.  Note that

    the interpretation of mono recordings depends on your system - on most

    systems making a mono recording of a stereo input will result in the

    two channels being mixed, but on other systems it could give you just

    the left channel, for example.<p>

 

<li><b>Play While Recording</b>: Check this box if you want to record

    multiple tracks over top of one another!  Record the first track as

    usual.  Then, with this box checked, click record again.  The first

    track you recorded will play, but <b>Audacity</b> will also record a

    new track at the same time, maybe allowing you to sing harmony with

    yourself or add realtime sound effects to a recording.

    <p>

    You may notice that when you play the two tracks you recorded

    together, they aren't synchronized.  This is normal and is not the

    fault of <b>Audacity</b>.  To fix it, you will need to grab the

    <a href="toolbar.htm#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool and slide one

    of the tracks around until it sounds right.    

    <p>

</ul>



<a name="rateset"></a>

<p><b>Sample Rate Settings</b>

<p>This panel sets the default sample rate for new projects.  It does not

   affect any existing project - to change the sample rate of an existing

   project, just click on the rate at the bottom of the window and select

   a new rate from the pop-up menu.



<a name="fileform"></a>

<p><b>File Formats</b> 

<ul>

<li><b>When importing uncompressed audio files...</b>



   <ul>

   <li>Make a copy of the file to edit: selecting this means that

       <b>Audacity</b> will run a little bit slower, but it will

       always have its own copy of any audio you are using in a

       project.  You can move, change, or throw away your files

       immediately after you open or import them into Audacity.

   

   <li>Edit the original in place: selecting this operation means

       that <b>Audacity</b> depends on your original audio files

       being there, and only stores changes you make to these

       files.  If you move, change, or throw away one of the files

       you imported into <b>Audacity</b>, your project may become

       unusable.  However, because <b>Audacity</b> doesn't need to

       make copies of everything, it can import files much more

       quickly this way.

   </ul>



<li><b>Uncompressed Export Format</b>: This lets you select the

    format that Audacity will use when you export uncompressed

    files, i.e. anything other than MP3.



<li><b>MP3 Export Setup</b>: Use these controls to locate your

    MP3 encoder and set the quality of MP3 encoding.  Higher

    quality files take up more space, so you will need to find

    the level of quality you feel is the best compromise.

    For more information, see

    <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.



</ul>



<a name="spectrograms"></a>

<p><b>Spectrograms</b>

<p>You can view any audio track as a Spectrogram instead of a

   Waveform by selecting one of the Spectral views from the

   track's pop-up menu.  This dialog lets you adjust some of

   the settings for these spectrograms.



<ul>

<li><b>FFT Size:</b> The size of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

    affects how much vertical (frequency) detail you see.  Larger

    FFT sizes give you more bass resolution and less temporal

    resolution, and they are slower. 



<li><b>Grayscale</b>: Select this for gray spectrograms instead of

    colored ones.



<li><b>Maximum Frequency</b>: Set this value anywhere from a couple

    of hundred hertz to half the sample rate (i.e. 22050 Hz if the

    sample rate is 44100 Hz).  For some applications, such as speech

    recognition or pitch extraction, very high frequencies are not

    important (visually), so this allows you to hide these and only

    focus on the ones you care about.



</ul>



<a name="directories"></a>

<p><b>Directories</b>

<p>Use this panel to set the location of Audacity's temporary

   directory.  Audacity uses this directory whenever you work on

   a project that you haven't saved as an AUP file yet.
