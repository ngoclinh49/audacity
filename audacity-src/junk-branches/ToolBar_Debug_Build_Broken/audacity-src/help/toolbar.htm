Toolbar

<a name="selection"></a>

<p><img src="select.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Selection Tool

</b></font> 



<p>This is the main tool you use to select audio.  Click in a track to

position the cursor, or click and drag to select a range of audio.  If

you drag from one track to another, you can select multiple tracks.

Extend a selection by shift-clicking a new point in the track.

<p>

Playback will always begin at the position of the selection cursor.

If a range of audio is selected, only the selected range will play.



<a name="envelope"></a>

<p><img src="amp.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Envelope Tool

</b></font>



<p>The envelope tool gives you detailed control over how tracks fade

in and out, right in the main track window.  When the envelope tool

is selected, the amplitude envelope of each track is highlighted in

a green line, with control points at the beginning and end of each

track.  To change a control point, click it and drag it to a new

position.  To add a new point, click anywhere in the track where there

is not already a control point.  To remove a point, click on it and

drag it outside of the track until it disappears, then release.



<a name="timeshift"></a>

<p><img src="move.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Time Shift Tool

</b></font>



<p>This tool allows you to change the relative positioning of tracks

relative to one another in time.  To use this tool, simply click in a

track and drag it to the left or right.  To align two tracks together

or reset their time shift back to zero, use the

<a href="menu4.htm#aligntogether">Align Tracks Together</a> or

<a href="menu4.htm#alignzero">Align with Zero</a> 

commands.



<a name="zoom"></a>

<p><img src="zoom.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Zoom Tool

</b></font>



<p>This tool allows you to zoom in or out of a specific part of the audio.

To zoom in, click anywhere in the audio.  To zoom out, right-click or

shift-click.  If you have a middle button, you can middle-click to

do the same thing as 

<a href="menu3.htm#zoomnormal">Zoom Normal</a>.

<p>

In addition, you can zoom into a region by clicking and dragging the mouse

to highlight the region you want to see, then releasing the mouse button.



<a name="play"></a>

<p><img src="play.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Play Button

</b></font>



<p>Press the play button to listen to the audio in your project.  You can

also hit the spacebar to start or stop playback.  Playback begins

at the current cursor position.  If a region of audio is selected, only

the selected region will play.  To quickly play the entire project,

execute 

<a href="menu2.htm#selectall">Select All</a> before playing.

If there are multiple tracks going to the same channel in your

project, they will be mixed automatically for playback.



<a name="stop"></a>

<p><img src="stop.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Stop Button

</b></font>



<p>Press the stop button or hit the spacebar to stop playback immediately.



<a name="record"></a>

<p><img src="record.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Record Button

</b></font>



<p>Press the record button to record a new track from your computer's

sound input device.  Use the 

<a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a> to configure the recording options.

In particular, there is an option to record stereo or mono, and there is

an option to play the other tracks while recording, which doesn't work

on all systems.

<p>

Recording always happens at the project's sample rate.



<a name="gain"></a>

<p><img src="volume.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>

Master Gain Control

</b></font>



<p>The Master Gain Control is a slider which controls the volume of the

audio output by Audacity to your hardware.  Pushing the slider all the

way to the left will mute Audacity, and pushing it to the right will

increase the volume of everything beyond its normal level and may cause

clipping.
