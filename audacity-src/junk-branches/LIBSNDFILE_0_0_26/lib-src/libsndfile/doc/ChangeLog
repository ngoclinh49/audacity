    Fixed a bugs uncovered by the new test programs above.

2001-09-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c wav.c
    Fixed a bug preventing reading a file from stdin. Found by T. Narita.

2001-09-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.h
    Fixed a problem on OpenBSD 2.9 which was causing sf_seek() to fail on IMA WAV
    files. Root cause was the declaration of the func_seek typedef not matching the 
    functions it was actually being used to point to. In OpenBSD sizeof (off_t) != 
    sizeof (int). Thanks to Heikki Korpela for allowing me to log into his OpenBSD
    machine to debug this problem.

2001-09-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c 
    Implemented sf_command ("norm float").
    
    * src/*.c
    Implemented handling of sf_command ("norm float"). Float normalization can now
    be turned on and off.
    
    * tests/double_test.c
    Renamed to floating_point_test.c. Modified to include tests for all scaled reads 
    and writes of floats and doubles.

    * src/au_g72x.c
    Fixed bug in normalization code found with improved floating_point_test program.

    * src/wav.c

    annotations from WAV files.

    * src/aiff.c
    Added code for parsing '(c) ' and 'ANNO' chunks. Will be used for extract text 
    annotations from WAV files.

    * examples/sf_info.c example/Makefile.am
    Renamed to sndfile_info.c. The program sndfile_info will now be installed when the 
    library is installed.

    * src/floatcast.h
    New file defining floating point to short and int casts. These casts will
    eventually replace all flot and double casts to short and int. See comments at
    the top of the file for the reasoning.
    
    * src/*.c
    Changed all default float and double casts to short or int with macros defined
    in floatcast.h. At the moment these casts do nothing. They will be replaced 
    with faster float to int cast operations in the near future.

2001-08-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>
    
    * tests/command_test.c
    New file for testing sf_command () functionality.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Revisiting of error return values of some functions.
    Started implementing sf_command () a new function will allow on-the-fly modification
    of library behaviour, or instance, sample value scaling.

    * src/common.h
    Added hook for format specific sf_command () calls to SNDFILE struct.
    
    * doc/api.html

    New documentation file explaining new sf_command () function.

2001-08-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed error return values from sf_read*() and sf_write*(). There were numerous
    instances of -1 being returned through size_t. These now all set error int the
    SF_PRIVATE struct and return 0. Thanks to David Viens for spotting this.

2001-08-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>
    
    * src/common.c
    Fixed use of va_arg() calls that were causing warning messages with the latest
    version of gcc (thanks Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu).

    * src/*.c src/sfendian.h 
    Moved definition of MAKE_MARKER macro to sfendian.h

2001-07-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified sf_get_lib_version () so that version string will be visible using the
    Unix strings command.

    * examples/Makefile.am examples/sfinfo.c
    Renamed sfinfo program and source code to sf_info. This prevents a name clash
    with the program included with libaudiofile.

2001-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/read_seek_test.c tests/lossy_comp_test.c

2001-07-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/paf.c src/svx.c src/wav.c
    Converted these files to using psf_binheader_readf() function. Will soon be ready
    to make reading writing from pipes work reliably.

    * src/*.[ch]
    Added code for sf_read_float () and sf_readf_float () methods of accessing 
    file data.
    
2001-07-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/paf.c src/wav_gsm610.c

    * src/wav_gsm610.c
    Fixed a bug which prevented GSM 6.10 encoded WAV files generated by libsndfile from 
    being played in Windoze (thanks klay).

2001-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.[ch]
    Implemented psf_binheader_readf() which will do for file header reading what
    psf_binheader_writef() did for writing headers. Will eventually allow
    libsndfile to read and write from pipes, including named pipes.

2001-07-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * MacOS/config.h Win32/config.h
    Attempted to bring these two files uptodate with src/config.h. As I don't have
    access to either of these systems support for them may be completely broken.

2001-06-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/float32.c
    Fixed bug for big endian processors that can't read 32 bit IEEE floats. Now tested 
    on Intel x86 and UltraSparc processors.

2001-06-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Modified to allow REX files (from Propellorhead's Recycle and Reason programs) to 
    be read.
    REX files are basically an AIFF file with slightly unusual sequence of chunks
    (AIFF files are supposed to allow any sequence) and some extra  application 
    specific information. 
    Not yet able to write a REX file as the details of the application specific
    data is unknown.

2001-06-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed endian bug when reading PEAK chunk on big endian machines.

    * src/common.c
    Fixed endian bug when reading PEAK chunk on big endian machines with 
    --enable-force-broken-float configure option.

2001-06-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in src/config.h.in
    Removed old CAN_READ_WRITE_x86_IEEE configure variable now that float capabilities
    are detected at run time.
    Added FORCE_BROKEN_FLOAT to allow testing of broken float code on machines where
    the processor can in fact handle floats correctly. 
    
    * src/float32.c
    Rejigged code reading and writing of floats on broken processors.
    
    * m4/
    Removed this directory and all its files as they are no longer needed.

2001-06-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/peak_chunk_test.c
    New test to validate reading and writing of peak chunk.
    
    * examples/sfconvert
    Added -float32 option.

    * src/*.c
    Changed all error return values to negative values (ie the negative of what they
    were). 
    
    * src/sndfile.c tests/error_test.c
    Modified to take account of the previous change.

2001-06-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/float32.c
    File renamed from wav_float.c and renamed function to something more general.
    Added runtime detection of floating point capabilities. 
    Added recording of peaks during write for generation of PEAK chunk. 
    
    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handing for PEAK chunk for floating point files. PEAK is read when the
    file headers are read and generated when the file is closed. Logic is in place
    for adding PEAK chunk to end of file when writing to a pipe (reading and writing 
    from/to pipe to be implemented soon).

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified sf_signal_max () to use PEAK values if present.

2001-06-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    to functions in this file from the filetype specific files.
    
    * src/*.c
    Added alaw_read_init (), alaw_write_int (), ulaw_read_init () and ulaw_write_init () 
    and removed all other calls to functions in alaw.c and ulaw.c from the filetype 
    specific files.
    
    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests to validate sf_seek () on all file types.

    * src/raw.c
    Implemented raw_seek () function to fix a bug where sf_seek (file, 0, SEEK_SET) on a 
    RAW file failed.

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug in paf24_seek () found due to added seeks tests in tests/write_read_test.c

2001-05-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * check_libsndfile.py
    New file for the regression testing of libsndfile. 
    check_libsndfile.py is a Python script which reads in a file containing 
    filenames of audio files. Each file is checked by running the examples/sfinfo 
    program on them and checking for error or warning messages in the libsndfile 
    log buffer.

    * check_libsndfile.list
    This is an example list of audio files for use with check_libsndfile.py

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Changed the defined value of M_PI for math header files which don't have it.
    This fixed validation test failures on MetroWerks compilers. Thanks to Lord 
    Praetor Satanus of Acheron for bringing this to my attention.

2001-05-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.[ch]
    Removed psf_header_setf () which was no longer required after refactoring
    and simplification of header writing.
    Added 'z' format specifier to psf_binheader_writef () for zero filling header 
    with N bytes. Used by paf.c and nist.c

    * tests/check_log_buffer.c
    New file implementing check_log_buffer () which reads the log buffer of a SNDFILE*
    object and searches for error and warning messages. Calls exit () if any are found.

    * tests/*.c 
    Added calls to check_log_buffer () after each call to sf_open_XXX ().

2001-05-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    psf_asciiheader_printf () and psf_binheader_writef ().
    Changed name of internal header manipulation function psf_hsetf () to 
    psf_header_setf (). 

2001-05-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/nist.c
    Fixed reading and writing of sample_byte_format header. "01" means little endian 
    and "10" means big endian regardless of bit width.

    * configure.in
    Detect Mac OSX and disable -Wall and -pedantic gcc options. Mac OSX is way screwed
    up and spews out buckets of warning messages from the system headers.
    Added --disable-gcc-opt configure option (sets gcc optimisation to -O0 ) for 
    easier debugging.
    Made decision to harmonise source code version number and .so library version

    Minor changes to allow writing of GSM 6.10 WAV files.

2000-02-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in Makefile.am src/Makefile.am
    Finally got around to figuring out how to build a single library from 
    multiple source directories.
    Reading GSM 6.10 files now seems to work.

2000-01-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Added more error reporting in read_fmt_chunk().

1999-12-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * examples/sfinfo.c
    Modified program to accept multiple filenames from the command line.

1999-11-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Moved code around in preparation to adding ability to read/write IMA ADPCM
    encoded AIFF files.

1999-11-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.c
    Fixed put_int() and put_short() macros used by _psf_hprintf() which were 
    causing seg. faults on Sparc Solaris.

1999-11-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.c
    Added string.h to includes. Thanks to Sigbjxrn Skjfret.

    * src/svx.c
    Fixed __svx_close() function to ensure FORM and BODY chunks are correctly
    set.

1999-10-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/au.c
    Fixed handling of incorrect size field in AU header on read. Thanks to 
    Christoph Lauer for finding this problem.

1999-09-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed a bug with incorrect SSND chunk length being written. This also lead
    to finding an minor error in AIFF header parsing. Thanks to Dan Timis for 
    pointing this out.

1999-09-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug with reading and writing 24 bit stereo PAF files. This problem
    came to light when implementing tests for the new functions which operate
    in terms of frames rather than items.

1999-09-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified file type detection to use first 12 bytes of file rather than 
    file name extension. Required this because NIST files use the same 
    filename extension as Microsoft WAV files.

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Added short, int and double read/write functions which work in frames rather 
    than items. This was originally suggested by Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu

1999-09-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/svx.c
    Finished off implementation of write using __psf_hprintf().

1999-09-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.h
    Added a buffer to SF_PRIVATE for writing the header. This is required
    to make generating headers for IFF/SVX files easier as well as making
    it easier to do re-write the headers which will be required when 
    sf_rewrite_header() is implemented.

    * src/common.c
    Implemented __psf_hprintf() function. This is an internal function
    which is documented briefly just above the code.

1999-09-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a bug in sf_write_raw() where it was returning incorrect values
    (thanks to Richard Dobson for finding this one). Must put in a test 
    routine for sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed default FORMsize in __aiff_open_write ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added copy of filename to internal data structure. IFF/SVX files 
    contain a NAME header chunk. Both sf_open_read() and sf_open_write()
    copy the file name (less the leading path information) to the
    filename field.

    * src/svx.c
    Started implementing writing of files.

1999-08-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/svx.c
    New file for reading/writing 8SVX and 16SVX files.

    * src/sndfile.[ch] src/common.h
    Changes for SVX files.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed header parsing when unknown chunk is found.

1999-08-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/paf.c
    New file for reading/writing Ensoniq PARIS audio file format.

    * src/sndfile.[ch] src/common.h
    Changes for PAF files.

    * src/sndfile.[ch]
    Added stuff for sf_get_lib_version() function.


1999-07-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.h MacOS/config.h
    Fixed minor MacOS configuration issues.

1999-07-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * MacOS/
    Added a new directory for the MacOS config.h file and the
    readme file.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed calculation of datalength when reading SSND chunk. Thanks to
    Sigbjørn Skjæret for pointing out this error.

1999-07-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h src/raw.c
    Further fixing of #includes for MacOS.

1999-07-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added call to ferror () in main header parsing loop of __XXX_open_read
    functions. This should fix problems on platforms (MacOS, AmigaOS) where 
    fseek()ing or fread()ing beyond the end of the file puts the FILE*
    stream in an error state until clearerr() is called.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for RAW header-less PCM files.

    * src/common.h
    Moved definition of struct tribyte to pcm.c which is the only place
    which needs it.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all code which assumed sizeof (struct tribyte) == 3. This code
    did not work on MacOS. Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    * src/au.c
    Removed <sys/stat.h> from list of #includes (not being used).

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.

    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.

    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific typedef for off_t.

    * MacOS-readme.txt
    New file with instructions for building libsndfile under MacOS. Thanks
    to Ben "Jacobs" for supplying these instructions.

1999-07-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    Removed sndfile.h from generated file list as there were no longer
    any autoconf substitutions being made.

    * src/raw.c
    New file for handling raw header-less PCM files. In order to open these
    for read, the user must specify format, pcmbitwidth and channels in the
    SF_INFO struct when calling sf_open_read ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added support for raw header-less PCM files.    

1999-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * examples/sfinfo.c
    Removed options so the sfinfo program always prints out all the information.

1999-07-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/alaw.c
    New file for A-law encoding (similar to u-law).

    * tests/alaw_test.c
    New test program to test the A-law encode/decode lookup tables.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for a-law encoded WAV, AU and AULE files.

1999-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c src/au.c
    Removed second "#include <unistd.h>". Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing
    this out.

1999-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/ulaw_test.c
    New test program to test the u-law encode/decode lookup tables.

1999-07-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.h
    Made corrections to comments on the return values from sf_seek ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed boundary condition checking bug and accounting bug in sf_read_raw ().

1999-07-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/au.c src/ulaw.c
    Finished implementation of u-law encoded AU files.

    * src/wav.c
    Implemented reading and writing of u-law encoded WAV files.

    * tests/
    Changed name of adpcm_test.c to lossy_comp_test.c. This test program
    will now be used to test Ulaw and Alaw encoding as well as APDCM.
    Added tests for Ulaw encoded WAV files.

1999-07-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Initialised amp variable in gen_signal() to remove compiler warning.

1999-07-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    In __aiff_open_read () prevented fseek()ing beyond end of file which 
    was causing trouble on MacOS with the MetroWerks compiler. Thanks to
    Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    *src/wav.c
    Fixed as above in __wav_open_read ().

1999-07-01    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Implemented MS ADPCM encoding. Code cleanup of decoder.

    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Added tests for MS ADPCM WAV files.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed incorrect parameter in call to srate2blocksize () from
    __ima_writer_init ().

1999-06-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Added test for 8 bit AIFF files.

1999-06-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Removed test for IMA ADPCM WAV files which is now done in adpcm_test.c

    * configure.in
    Added -Wconversion to CFLAGS. 

    * src/*.c tests/*.c examples/*.c
    Fixed all warnings resulting from use of -Wconversion. 

1999-06-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Added fact chunk handling on read and write for all non WAVE_FORMAT_PCM
    WAV files.

    * src/wav_ima.c
    Changed block alignment to be dependant on sample rate. This should make
    WAV files created with libsndfile compatible with the MS Windows media
    players.

    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Reimplemented adpcm_test_short and implemented adpcm_test_int and adpcm_test_double.
    Now have full testing of IMA ADPCM WAV file read, write and seek.

1999-06-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_float.c
    Fixed function prototype for x86f2d_array () which was causing ocassional 
    seg. faults on Sparc Solaris machines.

1999-06-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed bug in __aiff_close where the length fields in the header were
    not being correctly calculated before writing.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Modified to detect the above bug in WAV, AIFF and AU files.

1999-06-12    Erik de Castro Lopo     <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * Win32/*
    Added a contribution from Albert Faber to allow libsndfile to compile
    under Win32 systems. libsndfile will now be used as part of LAME the
    the MPEG 1 Layer 3 encoder (http://internet.roadrunner.com/~mt/mp3/).

1999-06-11    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    Changed to reflect previous changes.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed incorrect calculation of bytespersec header field (IMA ADPCM only).

    Fixed bug when writing from int or double data to IMA ADPCM file. Will need 
    to write test code for this.

    Fixed bug in __ima_write () whereby the length of the current block was 
    calculated incorrectly. Thanks to Jongcheon Park for pointing this out.

1999-03-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c
    Changed all read/write/lseek function calls to fread/fwrite/
    fseek/ftell and added error checking of return values from
    fread and fwrite in critical areas of the code.

    * src/au.c
    Fixed incorrect datasize element in AU header on write.

    * tests/error_test.c
    Add new test to check all error values have an associated error
    string. This will avoid embarrassing real world core dumps.

1999-03-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handling for unknown chunk markers in the file. 

1999-03-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Filled in missing error strings in SndfileErrors array. Missing entries 
    can cause core dumps when calling sf_error-str (). Thanks to Sam 
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com> for finding this problem.

1999-03-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Work on wav_ms_adpcm.c uncovered a bug in __ima_read () when reading 
    stereo files. Caused by not adjusting offset into buffer of decoded
    samples for 2 channels. A similar bug existed in __ima_write ().
    Need a test for stereo ADPCM files.

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Decoder working correctly.

1999-03-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    Added --enable-justsrc configuration variable sent by Sam
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com>.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug when reading beyond end of data section due to not
    checking pima->blockcount.
    This uncovered __ima_seek () bug due to pima->blockcount being set 
    before calling __ima_init_block ().

1999-03-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing MS ADPCM decoder. 
    If file is WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM and length of data chunk is odd, this
    encoder seems to add an extra byte. Why not just give an even data
    length? 

1999-03-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Split code out of wav.c to create wav_float.c and wav_ima_adpcm.c.
    This will make it easier to add and debug other kinds of WAV files
    in future.

1999-03-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/
    Added adpcm_test.c which implements test functions for
    IMA ADPCM reading/writing/seeking etc.

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed many bugs in IMA ADPCM encoder and decoder. 

1999-03-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Finished implementing IMA ADPCM encoder and decoder (what a bitch!). 

1999-03-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing IMA ADPCM decoder. 

1999-03-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed bug where the sf_read_XXX functions were returning a 
    incorrect read count when reading past end of file.
    Fixed bug in sf_seek () when seeking backwards from end of file.

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Added multiple read test to short_test(), int_test () and
    double_test ().
    Added extra chunk to all test WAV files to test that reading
    stops at end of 'data' chunk.

1999-02-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for little DEC endian AU files.

    * src/au.c
    Add handling for DEC format little endian AU files.

1999-02-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/wav.c
    Add __psf_sprintf calls during header parsing.

    * src/sndfile.c src/common.c
    Implement sf_header_info (sndfile.c) function and __psf_sprintf (common.c).

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 8 bit PCM files (WAV, AIFF and AU).

    * src/au.c src/aiff.c
    Add handling of 8 bit PCM data format.

    * src/aiff.c
    On write, set blocksize in SSND chunk to zero like everybody else.

1999-02-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed bug in let2s_array (cptr was not being initialised).

    * src/sndfile.c:
    Fixed bug in sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw. sf_seek should
    now work when using these functions.

1999-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c:
    Force test_buffer array to be double aligned. Sparc Solaris
    requires this.

1999-02-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed a bug which was causing errors in the reading
    and writing of 24 bit PCM files.

    * doc/api.html
    Finished of preliminary documentaion.

1999-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zip DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c:
    Changed reading of 'COMM' chunk to avoid reading an int
    which overlaps an int (4 byte) boundary.
