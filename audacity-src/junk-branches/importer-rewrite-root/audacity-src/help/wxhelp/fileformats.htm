<a name="aup"></a>
<p class=qy><font size="+2">Audacity Project format (AUP)</font></p>

<p class=a>Audacity projects are stored in an AUP file, which is a format that
has been highly optimized for Audacity so that it can open and save
projects extremely quickly.  In order to achieve this speed, Audacity
breaks larger audio files into several smaller pieces and stores these
pieces in a directory with a similar name as the project.
For example, if you name a project "chanson", then Audacity will create a
project file called <tt>chanson.aup</tt> which stores the general
information about your project, and it will store your audio in several
files inside a directory called <tt>chanson_data</tt>.
The Audacity Project format is not compatible with any other audio
programs, so when you are finished working on a project and you
want to be able to edit the audio in another program, select
<a href="#export">Export</a>.</p>


<a name="wav"></a>
<p class=qy><font size="+2">WAV (Windows Wave format)</font></p>

<p class=a>This is the default uncompressed audio format on Windows, and is supported
on almost all computer systems.  Audacity can read and write this format.</p>


<a name="aiff"></a>
<p class=qy><font size="+2">AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)</font></p>

<p class=a>This is the default uncompressed audio format on the Macintosh, and it
is supported by most computer systems, but it is not quite as common as
the WAV format.  Audacity can read and write this format.</p>

<a name="au"></a>
<p class=qy><font size="+2">Sun Au / NeXT</font></p>

<p class=a>This is the default audio format on Sun and NeXT computers, and it is
usually very slightly compressed, so it is not a very high quality
format.  This format was one of the first audio formats supported by
Web browsers, and it is still often used for short sound effects where
quality is not as important.  Audacity can read this format.</p>

<a name="ircam"></a>
<p class=qy><font size="+2">IRCAM (Institut de Recherce et Coordination Acoustique/Musique)</font></p>

<p class=a>This is a very general file format that is commonly used by
computer music researchers.  Audacity can read this format.</p>


<a name="mp3"></a>
<p class=qy><font size="+2">MP3 (MPEG I, layer 3)</font></p>

<p class=a>This is a compressed audio format that is a very popular way to
store music.  It can compress audio by a factor of 10:1 with very
little degradation in quality.  Audacity can both import and export
this format.  For more information on how to export MP3 files from
within Audacity, see <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.</p>


<a name="ogg"></a>
<p class=qy><font size="+2">Ogg Vorbis</font></p>

<p>This is a new compressed audio format that was designed to be a free
alternative to MP3 files.  Ogg Vorbis files are not as common, but
they are about the same size as MP3 with very similar quality
(and getting better).  Audacity can import and export this format.
