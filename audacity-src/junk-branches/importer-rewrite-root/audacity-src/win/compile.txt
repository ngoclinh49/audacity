================================================================

Before trying to compile Audacity, please make sure that
your copy of Visual C++ 6.0 has been upgraded to Service
Patch 5.  If you require it, this patch is available from
Microsoft at

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp5/default.asp

It is worth noting that Audacity uses VC++'s multithreaded
statically-linked run-time libraries.

---------------------------
STEP 1:  Download wxWindows
---------------------------
To simplify the implementation of a near-identical user
interface across platforms, Audacity uses classes and
resources from wxWindows, a portable GUI framework for C++
(and Python).  You must download and build wxWindows before
attempting to compile Audacity, or nothing will work!

wxWindows is available from http://www.wxwindows.org.
Similar to the Linux kernel, wxWindows is available as
stable and development branches.  Audacity is currently
written against wxWindows 2.2.9, which can be downloaded
from

  http://www.wxwindows.org/dl_msw2.htm#stable

------------------------
STEP 2:  Build wxWindows
------------------------
When you have downloaded and installed wxWindows, you must
build it.  First though, to be compatible with Audacity, you
must alter the build settings to use the multithreaded
statically-linked run-time libraries instead of the
multithreaded DLL run-time libraries.  This isn't hard:

1. Launch Visual C++ and open the workspace file called
   "wxvc.dsw" in the "wx2\src" directory of your wxWindows
   installation.  (Ignore "wxvc_dll.dsw".)

2. Select "Project"->"Settings" (Alt+F7), choose "Win32 Release"
   in the "Settings For" combo box and select everything visible
   in the tree window on the left of the dialog box.

3. Now select the "C/C++" tab and change "Use run-time library"
   under the 'Code Generation' combo box to "Multithreaded".

4. Now select "Win32 Debug" from the "Settings For" combo and
   change the run-time library to "Debug Multithreaded".

5. Now you can click "OK" and build wxWindows by selecting
   "Build"->"Batch Build" and clicking "Rebuild All".

This will build both Debug and Release versions of the
wxWindows library.

--------------------------
STEP 3:  Download Audacity
--------------------------
Now you can compile Audacity.  If you want to checkout a
copy of the latest source code from CVS (assuming you
haven't already!), there are instructions at
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/cvs.php. Run Visual C++ and
load the Audacity workspace: it's "audacity.dsw" in the
"win" directory of the Audacity source tree.

--------------------------------------------
STEP 4:  Set wxWindows location for Audacity
--------------------------------------------
Before you can start the build process, you must update the
project settings to tell Visual C++ where to find wxWindows.
There are three settings that need changing:
    1.  Include Directories (e.g. D:\wxWindows\wx2\include)
    2.  Resource Directory  (e.g. D:\wxWindows\wx2\include)
    3.  Library Directory   (e.g. D:\wxWindows\wx2\lib)

There are at least two ways you can set the directories.
Select the best option for your development environment.

-----------------------------------------------------
OPTION 4-1. Set wxWindows directories global for VC++
-----------------------------------------------------
This is the "easiest" option, and you only have to do it once.
The disadvantage is it puts the wxWindows directories in
the path for all of the builds you do from Visual Studio for
VC++.

Go to the "Tools"->"Option" menu item in Visual Studio.
Select the Directories tab in the popup.

1.  Select "Include files" in the right combo box and add the
    wxWindows include directory to the end of the list.  This
    also sets the resource directory automatically.
    (Hint: Click twice on the empty dotted box.)
2.  Select "Library files" in the right combo box and add the
    wxWindows lib directory to the end of the list.

Before building a debug version of Audacity, you may want to
do the following to eliminate link warning messages:

Go to the "Project"->"Settings" menu item in Visual Studio.

3. Ignore lib. Select "Win32 Debug" from the "Settings For"
   combo. Select only "Audacity" in the tree, the Link tab, and
   "Input" in the combo box. Enter "libcmtd.lib" in the
   "Ignore Libraries" box.
   (7/13/02 note: This may be added to the audacity.dsp file
   so you may not need to do this step in the future.)

--------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION 4-2. Set wxWindows directories in the Audacity dsp file
--------------------------------------------------------------
This option sets the wxWindows directories only for the Audacity
project; it does not affect any other projects you have.  The
disadvantage is that you have to redo this change everytime you
download a new version of audacity.dsp.

Go to the "Project"->"Settings" menu item in Visual Studio.

1. Include Directory. Select "All Configurations" from the
   "Settings For" combo and select all the top-level entries in
   the tree. Choose the "C/C++" tab, select "Preprocessor" from
   "Category" combo and enter the path of your wx2\include
   the directory in the "Additional Include Directories" box.
   (e.g. If you installed wxWindows in a directory called
   "D:\wxWindows" then enter "D:\wxWindows\wx2\include".)
   (Note: It may only be necessary to select the Audacity entry
   and not all top-level entries.  Would someone please try this
   and report?)

2. Resource Directory.  Select the "Resources" tab and add the
   same path as for the Include Directory in the "Additional
   resource include directories" box.

3. Libraries.  Deselect everything in the tree but
   "Audacity" and click on the "Link" tab.  Select "Input" from
   the "Category" combo and add the path of your wx2\lib
   directory to the end of the list of paths in the "Additional
   library path" box.  (eg ",D:\wxWindows\wx2\lib" - don't
   forget the comma!)

Before building a debug version of Audacity, you may want to
do the "Ignore lib" setting give above.

-----------------------
STEP 5:  Build Audacity
-----------------------
Now select the configuration that you wish to build
("Audacity - Win32 Release" for general use, "Audacity -
Win32 Debug" for a slower but debuggable executable) from
the "Build"->"Set Active Configuration" dialog and choose
"Build"->"Rebuild All" to compile Audacity!

That's all - if this procedure doesn't work, you can ask for
help on the Audacity development mailing list:
audacity-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  The first suggestion
is likely to be "try it again with a clean installation of
the wxWindows source and the latest Audacity source from
CVS" though, so if that's not what you just attempted, you
might want to try that first...
