<h1>File Menu</h1>
</font>

<b>New</b>&nbsp;&mdash; creates a new empty window
<br><p>

<b>Open...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; opens an audio file or an Audacity project in a new
window (unless the current window is empty).  To add audio files to
an existing project window, use one of the Import commands in the
<a href="menu_project.htm">Project</a> menu.
<br><p>

<p><b>Recent Files ...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; brings up a list of files you have recently 
opened in audacity to be re-opened quickly.</p><br><p> 

<b>Close</b>&nbsp;&mdash; closes the current window, asking you if you want to
save changes.  On Windows and Unix, closing the last window will quit Audacity, 
unless you modify this behavior in the Interface <a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a>.
<br><p>

<b>Save Project</b>&nbsp;&mdash; saves everything in the window into an Audacity-specific
format so that you can save and quickly continue your work later.  An Audacity
project consists of a project file, ending in <tt>".aup"</a>, and a project
data folder, ending in <tt>"_data"</tt>.  For example, if you name your
project "Composition", then Audacity will create a file called
<tt>"Composition.aup"</tt> and a folder called <tt>Composition_data</tt>.
Audacity project files are not meant to be shared with other programs; use
one of the Export commands (below) when you are finished editing a file.
<br><p>

<b>Save Project As...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; same as Save Project (above), but lets you
save a project as a new name.
<br><p>

<b>Edit ID3 Tags...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Opens a dialog allowing you to edit the ID3 tags 
associated with a project, for MP3 exporting.
<br><p>

<b>Import...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; a submenu to group functions to import existing files in 
your project, namely:
<ul>
<li><b>Audio...</b>&nbsp;&mdash;  
This command is used to import audio from a standard audio format into
your project.  Use this command if you already have a couple of tracks
and you want to add another track to the same project, maybe to mix
them together. You cannot use this option to import Audacity Projects.  
The only way to combine two Audacity Projects is to open them in separate 
windows, then copy and paste the tracks.</li>

<li><b>Labels...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This command takes a text file which contains 
time codes and labels, and turns them into a 
<a href="track_label.htm">Label Track</a>.</li>

<li><b>MIDI...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This menu command imports MIDI files and puts 
them into a <a href="track_midi.htm">MIDI Track</a>.  Audacity can display MIDI 
files, but <i>cannot play, edit, or save them yet.</i></li>

<li><b>Raw Data...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; This menu command allows you to open 
a file in virtually any uncompressed format.  When you select the file, Audacity will 
analyze it and try to guess its format. It will guess correctly about 90% of the time, 
so you can try just pressing "OK" and listening to the result.  If it is not correct, 
however, you can use the options in the dialog to try some other possible encodings.
<p>
At the beginning of your imported track(s), you may notice a little bit of noise.  This is 
probably the file's header, which Audacity was not able to parse.  Just zoom in and 
select the noise with the <a href="toolbar_control.htm">Selection Tool</a>, and then
choose Delete from the <a href="menu_edit.htm">Edit Menu</a>.</li></ul>
<br><p>

<b>Export As ...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; a submenu to group functions to export all 
of the audio in your project as a file of some format, namely:
<ul>
<li><b>WAV...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; exports all of the audio in your project as a
WAV file, an industry-standard format for uncompressed audio.  You can
change the standard file format used for exporting from Audacity by
opening the File Format <a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a>.
Note that exporting will automatically mix and resample if you have
more than one track, or varying sample rates.  See also
<a href="fileformats.htm">File Formats</a>.</li>

<li><b>MP3...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; exports all of the audio as an MP3 file.
MP3 files are compressed and therefore take up much less disk space,
but they lose some audio quality.  Another compressed alternative
is Ogg Vorbis (below).  You can set the quality of MP3 compression
in the File Format <a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a>.  See also
<a href="exportmp3.htm">MP3 Exporting</a>.</li>

<li><b>Ogg Vorbis...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; exports all of the audio as an Ogg Vorbis
file.  Ogg Vorbis files are compressed and therefore take up much less
disk space, but they lose some audio quality.  Ogg Vorbis files tend to
take up a little less disk space than MP3 for similar compression quality,
and Ogg Vorbis is free from patents and licensing restrictions, but
Ogg Vorbis files are not as widespread.  You can set the quality of
Ogg compression in the File Format <a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a>.
</li></ul><br><p>

<b>Export Selection As...</b&nbsp;&mdash; a submenu to group functions to export all 
of the selected audio in your project as a file of some format, namely:
<ul>
<li>WAV...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; exports all of the selected audio in your project as a WAV file.</li>

<li><b>MP3...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; exports all of the selected audio in your project as an MP3 file.</li>

<li><b>Ogg Vorbis...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; exports all of the selected audio in your project 
as an Ogg Vorbis file.</li></ul>
<br><p>

<b>Export Labels...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; if you have a 
<a href="track_label.htm">Label Track</a> in your project, this lets
you export the labels as a text file.  You can import labels in the
same text format using the "Import Labels..." command in the
<a href="menu_project.htm">Project Menu</a>.
<br><p>

<b>Export Multiple...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; lets you split your project into multiple files
all in one step.  You can either split them vertically (one new file per
track), or horizontally (using labels in a 
<a href="track_label.htm">Label Track</a> to indicate the breaks between
exported files.
<br><p>

<b>Process Batch...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; lets you apply a chain of effects and actions to 
selected files. Batch processing settings are available in <a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a> 
dialog.
<br><p>

<p><b>Page Setup...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; configure how Audacity will print out the track
waveforms using the Print option, and what printer to use.</p>

<p><b>Print...</b>&nbsp;&mdash; Print out the main window view from audacity showing the
tracks and waveforms.</p>
<br><p>

<b>Exit (Quit)</b>&nbsp;&mdash; closes all windows and exits Audacity, prompting you
to save any unsaved changes first.
