File Formats

<a name="aup"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Audacity Project format (AUP)

</b></font>



<p>Audacity projects are stored in an AUP file, which is a format that

has been highly optimized for Audacity so that it can open and save

projects extremely quickly.  In order to achieve this speed, Audacity

breaks larger audio files into several smaller pieces and stores these

pieces in a directory with a similar name as the project.

For example, if you name a project "chanson", then Audacity will create a

project file called <tt>chanson.aup</tt> which stores the general

information about your project, and it will store your audio in several

files inside a directory called <tt>chanson_data</tt>.

The Audacity Project format is not compatible with any other audio

programs, so when you are finished working on a project and you

want to be able to edit the audio in another program, select

<a href="#export">Export</a>.



<a name="wav"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

WAV (Windows Wave format)

</b></font>



<p>This is the default uncompressed audio format on Windows, and is supported

on almost all computer systems.  Audacity can read and write this format.



<a name="aiff"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)

</b></font>



<p>This is the default uncompressed audio format on the Macintosh, and it

is supported by most computer systems, but it is not quite as common as

the WAV format.  Audacity can read and write this format.



<a name="au"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Sun Au / NeXT

</b></font>



<p>This is the default audio format on Sun and NeXT computers, and it is

usually very slightly compressed, so it is not a very high quality

format.  This format was one of the first audio formats supported by

Web browsers, and it is still often used for short sound effects where

quality is not as important.  Audacity can read this format.



<a name="ircam"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

IRCAM (Institut de Recherce et Coordination Acoustique/Musique)

</b></font>



<p>This is a very general file format that is commonly used by

computer music researchers.  Audacity can read this format.

<a name="mp3"></a>



<p><font size=+0><b>

MP3 (MPEG II, layer 3)

</b></font>



<p>This is a compressed audio format that is a very popular way to

store music.  It can compress audio by a factor of 10:1 with very

little degradation in quality.  Audacity can both import and export

this format.  For more information on how to export MP3 files from

within Audacity, see <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.



<a name="ogg"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Ogg Vorbis

</b></font>



<p>This is a new compressed audio format that was designed to be a free

alternative to MP3 files.  Ogg Vorbis files are not as common, but

they are about the same size as MP3 with very similar quality

(and getting better).  Audacity can import this format, but it cannot

export it.
