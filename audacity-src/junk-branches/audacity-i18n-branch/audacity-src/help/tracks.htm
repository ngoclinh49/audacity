Audio tracks

</b></font>



<p>Audio tracks contain digitally sampled sounds.  In Audacity, two

stereo channels are represented by two stereo tracks.

Each audio track has a <i>sample rate</i>: common values include

8000 (telephone), 16000 (speech), 44100 (CD Audio), and 48000 (DAT).

(Note that Audacity does not yet support <i>automatic resampling</i>,

therefore you shouldn't have a track that's at a different rate

than your project's sample rate.

<p>Note tracks display data loaded from a MIDI file.  They are currently

not editable or playable.

Label tracks

</b></font>



<p>Label tracks can be used to annotate a document and later save these

annotations in a text file.

To create a Label track, select 

<a href="menu4.htm#newlabeltrack">New Label Track</a> from the

Project menu.  To add a new label, select some region of your audio

using the <a href="toolbar.htm#selection">Selection Tool</a>, and

then hit an alphanumeric key on the keyboard.  Anything you type

will go into the current label.  You can use the backspace key to

edit the current label.

<p>

Press Enter or Return to finish editing a label.<br>

Use the left and right arrow keys to move from one label to another.<br>

To select a label, click on it in the Label track.

To remove a label, select it, then use backspace to get rid of it,

then press Enter or Return.  Alternatively, you can select a range of

labels using the <a href="toolbar.htm#selection">Selection Tool</a>

and then select <a href="menu2.htm#silence">Silence</a> from the

Edit menu.
