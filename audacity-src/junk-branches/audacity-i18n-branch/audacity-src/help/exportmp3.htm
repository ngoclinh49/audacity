Exporting MP3 Files

</font>



<p>

<b>Audacity</b> cannot encode MP3 files by itself, because

the MP3 encoding algorithm is patented and cannot legally

be used in free programs.  However, <b>Audacity</b> has been

programmed to recognize other existing MP3 encoders that you

can download separately.  All you have to do is obtain the

appropriate MP3 encoder for your computer and then show

<b>Audacity</b> where it is located.

<b>For links to these MP3 encoders, go to the Audacity web page

(http://audacity.sourceforge.net) and click on the link for

your operating system.</b>

<p>



The first time you try to export an MP3 file, <b>Audacity</b>

will ask you to locate your MP3 encoder.  Locate the file

indicated above.  From then on, <b>Audacity</b> will not

need to ask you again and you will be able to export MP3

files easily!



<p>



Support for more MP3 encoders may be coming in the future.  Let us

know if there is a particular MP3 encoder you want supported.



<p>

<b>What is an MP3 file and how does it differ from WAV and AIFF files?</b>

<p>



MP3 (MPEG II, layer 3) is a popular format for storing music and

other audio.  A typical MP3 file is one tenth the size of the

original WAV or AIFF file, but it sounds very similar.  MP3

encoders make use of psychoacoustic models to, in effect,

"throw away" the parts of the sound that are very hard to hear,

while leaving the loudest and most important parts alone.

Unfortunately, no MP3 encoder is perfect, and so an MP3 file

will never sound quite as good as the original.  Still, most

people find that the quality of an MP3 file is virtually

indistinguishable from a CD when played on headphones or on

small computer speakers, which is why the format is so

popular.



<p>

<b>Why doesn't Audacity ship with an MP3 encoder?</b>

<p>



Unfortunately, the algorithm to encode or create MP3 files

is patented, and <b>Audacity</b> would not be able to

include an MP3 exporting algorithm without either

charging a fee or violating the law in many countries.
