What makes Audacity unique?

</font>

<br>

<ul>



<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

	is <it>free</it> and the source code is available

    under the GNU General Public License.



<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

	is <it>cross-platform</it> - it runs on Windows,

    MacOS, and many Unix platforms, including Linux.



<li>No limits on the number of tracks or the length of any track,

    except the size of your hard disk.



<li>Import almost anything: WAV, AIFF, Next/AU, IRCAM, MP3, and

    MIDI files are supported natively, but

	<font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

	will also open just about any uncompressed sound file and

	automatically deduce the format (using the

	<a href="menu4.htm#importraw">Import Raw Data...</a>

    feature).



<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

    not only includes many high-quality effects built-in, but also

    lets you use plug-in effects in the industry-standard VST format.

    There are dozens of free, shareware, and commercial VST

    plug-ins online that do everything from Reverb to

    Noise Reduction.



<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

	acts like a <it>non-destructive editor</it>, providing

    multiple levels of undo, but it also writes changes made to the

	audio to disk, eliminating the need for complicated real-time

	processing.



<li>Label tracks allow you to annotate waveforms (for example,

    transcribing speech) and later export the waveforms to a text file.



<li>Powerful spectral features allow you to view waveforms as

    spectrograms or plot the power spectrum of any region of audio,

	and even export this data to a spreadsheet.



</ul>
