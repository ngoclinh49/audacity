Plot Spectrum

</b></font>



<p>To use this feature, first select a region of audio from a single

track, then select "Plot Spectrum".  It opens up a window which

displays the Power Spectrum of the audio over that region, calculated

using the Fast Fourier Transform.  The graph represents how much

energy is in each frequency.  This window can also display other common

functions that are calculated using the Fast Fourier Transform, including

the Cepstrum and three versions of the Autocorrelation function.  The

Enhanced Autocorrelation function is very good at identifying the pitch

of a note.



<a name="float"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Float of Unfloat Palette

</b></font>



<p>Toggles between displaying the tool palette docked at the top of each

project window, or in a separate floating window.  You can also float

the tool palette by grabbing the handle on the left side and dragging

it to the location you want.
