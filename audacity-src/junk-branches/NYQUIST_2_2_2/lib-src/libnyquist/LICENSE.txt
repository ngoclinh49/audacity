Nyquist is in the process of being relicensed.  The new license will
be the BSD license, plus a non-binding request that the original
authors (David Michael Betz for xlisp and Roger Dannenberg for Nyquist)
be notified of any changes.  The authors have all agreed to this
relicensing; Roger Dannenberg is working on the wording now.
