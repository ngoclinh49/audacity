PortAudio is a portable audio I/O library designed for cross-platform

support of audio. It uses a callback mechanism to request audio processing.

Audio can be generated in various formats including 32 bit floating point

and will be converted to the native format internally.



Documentation:

	See "pa_common/portaudio.h" for API.

	See docs folder for a tutorial.

	And see "pa_common/patest_sine.c" for an example.



Files:

	pa_common/              = platform independant code

	pa_common/portaudio.h   = header file for PortAudio API. Specifies API.

	pa_common/pa_lib.c      = host independant code for DirectSound and Macintosh.

	pa_common/pa_rbuf.c     = ring Buffer used by blocking read/write.

	pa_common/pa_rw.c       = blocking read/write tool.



DirectSound Files:

	pa_win_ds/pa_dsound.c   = implementation of PA for DirectSound on a PC

	pa_win_ds/dsound_wrapper.cpp = wrapper for DirectSound C++ calls



Macintosh Files:

	pa_mac/pa_mac.c         = implementation for Macintosh Soundmanager



Test Programs

	pa_tests/pa_fuzz.c = guitar fuzz box

	pa_tests/pa_devs.c = print a list of available devices

	pa_tests/pa_minlat.c = determine minimum latency for your machine

	pa_tests/paqa_devs.c = self test that opens all devices

	pa_tests/paqa_errs.c = test error detection and reporting

	pa_tests/patest_clip.c = hear a sine wave clipped and unclipped

	pa_tests/patest_dither.c = hear effects of dithering (unlikely)

	pa_tests/patest_pink.c = fun with pink noise

	pa_tests/patest_record.c = record and playback some audio

	pa_tests/patest_sine.c = output a sine wave in a simple PA app

	pa_tests/patest_rw.c = blocking read/write

	pa_tests/patest_wire.c = pass input to output, wire simulator



Building PortAudio for DirectSound on PC



	PortAudio uses DirectSound so you must have a recent copy of DirectX

	from Microsoft installed on your computer.



	You must link your program with "dsound.lib" and "winmm.lib".



	Compile together:

		pa_win_ds\pa_dsound.c

		pa_win_ds\dsound_wrapper.c

		pa_common\pa_lib.c



Building PortAudio for SoundManager on Apple Macintosh



	Compile together:

		pa_mac\pa_mac.c

		pa_common\pa_lib.c



	Link with:

		SoundLib
