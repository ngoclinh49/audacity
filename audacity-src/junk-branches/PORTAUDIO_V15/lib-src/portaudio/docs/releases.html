<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>

<b>New Linux OSS Beta</b></li>

</ul>



<h4>

Windows WMME</h4>



<ul>

<li>

&nbsp;sDevicePtrs now allocated based on sizeof(pointer). Was allocating

too much space.</li>



<li>

&nbsp;Check for excessive numbers of channels. Some drivers reported bogus

numbers.</li>



<li>

Apply Mike Berry's changes for CodeWarrior on PC including condition including

of memory.h, and explicit typecasting on memory allocation.</li>

</ul>



<h4>

Macintosh Sound Manager</h4>



<ul>

<li>

ScanInputDevices was setting sDefaultOutputDeviceID instead of sDefaultInputDeviceID.</li>



<li>

Device Scan was crashing for anything other than siBadSoundInDevice, but

some Macs may return other errors! Caused failure to init on some G4s under

OS9.</li>



<li>

Fix TIMEOUT in record mode.</li>



<li>

Change CARBON_COMPATIBLE to TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>



<h2>

<b>V14 - 2/6/01</b></h2>



<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>

Added implementation for Windows MultiMedia Extensions (WMME) by Ross and

Phil</li>



<li>

Changed Pa_StopStream() so that it waits for the buffers to drain.</li>



<li>

Added Pa_AbortStream() that stops immediately without waiting.</li>



<li>

Added new test: patest_stop.c to test above two mods.</li>



<li>

Fixed Pa_StreamTime() so that it returns current play position instead

of the write position. Added "patest_sync.c" to demo audio/video sync.</li>



<li>

Improved stability of Macintosh implementation. Added timeouts to prevent

hangs.</li>



<li>

Added Pa_GetSampleSize( PaSampleFormat format );</li>



<li>

Changes some "int"s to "long"s so that PA works properly on Macintosh which

often compiles using 16 bit ints.</li>



<li>

Added Implementation Guide</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>



<h2>

<b>V12 - 1/9/01</b></h2>



<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>

Mac now scans for and queries all devices. But it does not yet support

selecting any other than the default device.</li>



<li>

Blocking I/O calls renamed to separate them from the PortAudio API.</li>



<li>

Cleaned up indentation problems with tabs versus spaces.</li>



<li>

Now attempts to correct bogus sample rate info returned from DirectSound

device queries.</li>

</ul>
