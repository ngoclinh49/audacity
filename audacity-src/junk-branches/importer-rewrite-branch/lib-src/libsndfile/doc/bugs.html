<BR><BR>
	I am interested in finding and fixing all genuine bugs in libsndfile. Bugs I want to
	fix include	any of the following problems (and probably others) :
	<UL>
	<LI>	compilation problems on new platforms
	<LI>	errors being detected during the `make check' process
	<LI>	segmentation faults occuring inside libsndfile
	<LI>	libsndfile hanging when opening a file
	<LI>	supported sound file types being incorrectly read or written
	<LI>	ommissions, errors or spelling mistakes in the documentation
	</UL>
	
<BR>
	When submitting a bug report you must include :
	<UL>
	<LI>	the operating system you are using
	<LI>	the compiler you are using 
	<LI>	a description of the problem
	<LI>	information generated by the sf_info program (see next paragraph)
	</UL>
	
<BR>
	If libsndfile compiles and installs correctly but has difficulty reading a particular 
	file or type of file you should run the <B>sf_info</B> program (from the examples 
	directory of the libsndfile distribution) on the file. See 
		<A HREF="sf_info.html">here</A>
	for an example of the use of the <B>sf_info</B> program.

<BR><BR>
	Please do not send me a sound file which fails to open under libsndfile unless I
	specifically ask you to. The above information should usually suffice for most
	problems.
	
<BR><BR>
	Once you have the above information you may mail it to me at
		 <A HREF="m&#97;ilt&#111;:&#101;rikd&#64;z&#105;p.&#99;om.au">&#101;rikd&#64;z&#105;p.&#99;om.au</a>.
