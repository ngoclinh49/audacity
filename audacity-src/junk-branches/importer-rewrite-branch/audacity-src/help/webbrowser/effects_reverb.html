<P class=qr>What is Reverb ?</P>
<P class=a>
 A Reverb simulates the component of sound that results from reflections from surrounding walls or objects.
 It is in effect a room simulator. Some people think it's just a delay effect with some filters, but it's way
 more complex than that.  This document explains the parameters to a Reverb effect and how they affect
the sound.
</P>
<P class=qr>Basic Simulation of a Room</P>
<P class=a>
 <B>Our model is a simple room</B> with four straight walls, a sound source and a listener. In <i>Figure 1</i>
 the arrows stand for the path of traveling sound.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The listener hears the DIRECT signal first. The DIRECT signal is also referred to as the DRY part of the signal when using
 any effect. Most digital reverbs produce two parts: The Early Reflections and the Reverb component.

 <P class=a>
  The path of the Early Reflections is longer than the direct signal, so it reaches the Listeners later.
  The difference in time between the arrival of
  the direct signal and the first Early Reflections is typically measured in milliseconds

 </P>
 <P class=a>
  <U><B>Predelay</B></U><BR>
  The time between the reception of the DIRECT signal by the listener and start of the Reverb portion
  of the effect is called <B>Predelay</B>. This is a parameter in many digital reverb effects, and it
  is also expressed in milliseconds.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  <U><B>Reverb Time</B></U><BR>
  The time difference between the end of the original sound and the level of the reverb resulting
  from that sound dropping by 60dB is called <B>RT60</B>, otherwise known as the <B>Reverb Time</b>. 
  In other words, it's how long it takes for the reverberations to die away almost completely.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  Some digital reverbs feature this as a parameter.

 The red vertical line on the left is the DIRECT SIGNAL, which is only kept for illustration and is usualy
 omitted when the reverb effect is used as a SEND effect.

 SEND effects are and why reverbs usualy are SEND effects.

 The surface of a wall as well as different shapes and sizes of objects in a room influence
 the way sound reflects, bends or spreads from off them.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Blank concrete will reflect sound quite well across the frequency spectrum. A large thick curtain
 or padded walls will reflect sound poorly. A large club filled with people sounds completly different
 from an empty one. People, comfy chairs, curtains, carpets, beds and many more objects reflect only
 part of the sound that hits them.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Most reverb effects therefore feature filters or hishelf and lowshelf EQs to simulate this kind
 of reverb behaviour.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Some reverb effect plugins (or hardware units) give you a <B>ROOM SIZE</B> parameter
</P>






<P class=qr>An example by the numbers</P>

<P class=a>
 As an example I'd like to show you how to create a reverb for small club
 with a band.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Let's see what we have to do with parameters in the reverb fx in sample
 editors. First we determine some basics about the room we want to simulate.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Our room(the club) is about eight meters on all sides(for simplicity)
 and three meters high. The band will be playing no more than four meters
 away from us. The room volume will be about 200 cubic meters.
</P>
<P class=a>
 This means that the DIRECT SOUND will get to you within about
 11 ms (milliseconds). This the time we'll need to take off the other values.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The first EARLY REFLECTIONS (off the left and right walls) travel
 around nine meters before reaching you, so they'll get to your ears about
 15 ms later! (9 meters at 343 meters/sec -> 26 ms minus the 11 ms the DIRECT
 SOUND takes to travel to your ears).
</P>
<P class=a>
 I'm not taking the floor into account because of the obstacles, such as your
 own legs and a table that prevents that reflection from the band from
 reaching you.  It is also probable that you're sitting close to a wall and
 the EARLY REFLECTION time may drop considerably. Experiment and listen very
 carefully.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The reason I'm deducting 11 ms from the 26 ms is that in a sample editor
 we already have the DIRECT SOUND.
 Please note that the timing of the EARLY REFLECTIONS are defined by the
 rooms characteristics such as shape and size. The sound colour of the
 EARLY REFLECTIONS is defined by the surfaces in the room.  These are parameters
 that are available to professional reverbs only (hardware or software), so don't
 worry about not finding that stuff in great detail in free or consumer software.

</P>
<P class=a>
 The PRE-DELAY and REVERB TIME depend on more than just room size.
 Wall and floor material, as well as anything else that reflects, disperses
 and dampens sound will influence the reverb in quite a few ways.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Our club has lots of wood on its walls and floor and people are sitting
 at tables and the air's probably filled with a little smoke (except in
 California!).
</P>
<P class=a>
 The REVERB TIME, a parameter found in just about all sample editors, should be set to
 no more than one second. In small, crowded rooms where little REVERB occurs
 it is quite important to set the EARLY REFLECTIONS right. Experiment with
 the reverb time keep it lower than 1.2 seconds and above 0.7 seconds.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The PRE-DELAY can be set to 30 ms or more. Larger rooms will develop REVERB
 later since the reflecting sound will travel a while before the reflections
 become hard to identify but it also depends on the reflecting materials.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Both Cool Edit and Soundforge have parameters referring to the DENSITY of the
 REVERB part of the sound. Materials such as polished marble will reflect the
 sound very well and disperse the sound very little. Wood disperses the sound
 a lot and a carpet practically swallows a large chunk of it.
 For our Club we need to set the density high since our material disperses the
 sound a lot(humans,wood and obstacles).
</P>
<P class=a>
 Higher frequencies are swallowed a lot faster than low frequencies.
 Many reverb algorithms refer to this in some form or another. Cool Edit
 has the 'High Frequency Absorbtion Time' as a parameter for this.
 Sound Forge gives you a choice, whether to do this at all for both low and
 high frequencies and even lets you set them but doesn't provide any time
 parameters. Professional Reverb hardware such as Lexicon PCM 70,80&90 let you
 you control frequency and time of this, for low and high frequencies.
</P>
<P class=a>
 This can effectively add to a room's liveliness.  A room full of people will
 absorb high frequencies a lot faster than an empty room, in which only the
 materials would make the difference, so in Cool Edit we'll set the 'High
 Frequency Absorbtion Time' very low, since we're in a crowded club.
 For Soundforge activate the 'Attenuate high frequencies above' box and set
 the frequency parameter to around 2000-2500 Hz. Experiment a bit. The higher
 this frequeny and the longer the Absorbtion Time parameter in Cool Edit,
 the emptier and and colder your room will seem. In small rooms this can
 cause the room to sound very metallic. Sewer pipes and oil pipelines e.g.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The last thing you have to do is set the balance between the WET signal
 and your original DRY signal. Here you can do as you please but remember
 that only very smoothed hard surfaces in big cavernous space create very loud
 reverbs. A church might do that if there aren't a big number of people and
 wooden benches in there, but a club doesn't :).
</P>
<P class=a>
 So when you create your next 'soon-to-be-the-hit-of-Hornet' module, be sure
 to check the possibilities of adding dimension and scope to your song.
 Put your snare to the front, the piano a little to the back, and the sax
 just a little in front of the drums. Experiment. With these basics you'll
 be able to get better results in less time.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Btw, Snare always gets reverb. How much and what kind up to you, but it's a
 generaly good thing. It's also important to decide whether you're trying to
 simulate a real live band or doint a multitrack sound, which boasts all kinds
 of nice ideas, like doubling(another take of the same thing on top of the
 first take), extreme panning and in general NOT reality :).
