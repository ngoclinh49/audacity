	A <a href="effects_reverb.html">Reverb</a> usualy gives you the choice of how
	much of the effect's signal (also called the WET part) and how much of the original
   signal (also called the DRY part) you'd like to the plugin to output.
</p>
<p class=a>
	A processor doesn't have this option by nature. The
	<a href="effects_eq.html">EQ</a>(ualizer) and the <a href="effects_compressor.html">Compressor</a>
	are processors. To mix the original signal and the processed signal doesn't make sense for these
	processors.  Their output is always 100% WET.

<td valign=top width="50%">

<p class=a>
	Not only do they output 100% WET signal, but nobody usually mixes the unprocessed signals with the processed
	either.
   In contrast, it is normal to mix the unprocessed and processed signals
   with effects such as <a href="effects_reverb.html">Reverb</a> and <a href="effects_delay.html">Delay</a>.
</p>
<p class=a>
	Processors are usually placed in an <B>INSERT</B>, which means they sit in the channel.
	The EQs on your stereo or soundcard mixer work like this. The signal passes through them.
