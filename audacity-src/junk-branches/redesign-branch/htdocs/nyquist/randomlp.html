Random Low pass Filter
<p>
Like someone is playing around with the cutoff frequency knob of
your low pass filter. As with Random Panning and Random Amp
Modulation, there are maxspeed and factor controls, plus a third
control, the maximum cutoff frequency of the low pass filter.
<p>
Once again, the lower you set maxspeed, the higher you must set
factor to get similar depth of random filtering result. You can use
factor to decrease or increase the amount of randomness modulation.

If you generate white noise then apply this effect, you can
_partially_ simulate wind sound. the rising and falling tones of
wind are for another plug-in...
