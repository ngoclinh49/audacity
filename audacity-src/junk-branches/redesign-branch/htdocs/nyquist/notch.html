Notch filter
<p>
Like its name suggests, a notch filter cuts out a "notch" in the
spectrum of your audio. The default frequency is 60Hz, great for
removing 60Hz electrical hum, in case your recording equipment has
picked this up.
<p>
The second control, q, determines the width of the notch cut from
your audio. Default q is 1, below 1 creates a wider notch, above 1
creates a narrower notch.

Works on mono and stereo audio.
