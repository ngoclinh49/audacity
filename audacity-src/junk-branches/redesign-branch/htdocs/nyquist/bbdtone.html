* Bouncing Ball Delay with Tone Shift
<p>
Combines the bouncing Ball Delay and Delay with Tone Shift plug-
ins. A delay effect in which the echos get faster, like a bouncing
ball. And each echo is shifted in pitch by the designated amount
(semitone plus cents (hundredths of a semitone)).
<p>
The value for the decay amount (in db) for an increasing pitch can
be left at the default 0. However, with decreasing pitch, the
lengths of the delays increase over time, overlapping with each
other more and more. In this case, clipping can occur if the decay
value is left at 0.
