Dual Tape Decks effect
<p>
This plug-in was written to duplicate an effect I heard in the late
1970s: I recorded then played identical audio on two mono tape
decks. There was an amazing "whooshing" effect as one tape deck
"caught up" with and passed what the other tape deck was playing.
This plug-in allows the "whooshing" to go back and forth. Different
effects are made using mono-sounding vs. "true" stereo audio.
<p>
You can adjust the phase difference between the two decks (180
degrees is the default), the starting phase of the effect (0
degrees is the default), LFO frequency and depth of the effect. The
larger depth is, the more pronounced the pitch and tempo shift
become until there is a noticeable warble.
<p>
Neat stereo flanger-like effects can be made by (for example)
applying dualtapedecks.ny to audio, applying Stereo Butterfly (static)
with a spread value of zero (sounds mono after applying), then
applying dualtapedecks.ny a second time with the same settings as the
first time.
<p>
This plug-in will work on mono audio as well, but the only effect
will be rising and falling changes in pitch and tempo.
