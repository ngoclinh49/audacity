Third in the series of Stereo Butterfly plug-ins. As with the
previous two, 0 setting sounds like mono, +1 is regular stereo, -1
is left and right channels flipped with each other.
<p>
Select which value to start at and which value to finish at. The
default is from 0 to 1, which creates the effect of your stereo
audio starting out sounding mono, then gradually "widening" to full
stereo as the selection progresses.
<p>
Start and finish values may lie anywhere between -1 and +1.
