<p>Generates a modulated pulse tone with the following parameters.<br>
key       - Tones frequency as MIDI key number 0...127<br>
cents     - Detune amount in cents 0...99<br>
Duration  - Tones duration in Milli seconds, 1...30000<br>
Mod Rate  - Number of modulation cycles, 1...100<br>
Mod Depth - Modulation depth as percent, -100...+100<br>
Mod Wave  - 0 = tri, 1 = up sawtooth, 2 = down sawtooth<br>
Width     - Fixed pulse width as percent. 0...100<br>
Amp       - Amplitude as percent 0...100<br>
<p>If the sum of the fixed width and the instantaneous modulation amount is<br>
outside the interval [0,99] The output will go to full off or full on.
