High Pass Filter with Q
<p>
A high pass filter with q, or resonance. the higher q is, the more
the cutoff frequency will resonate (produce a tone). (High pass
filter allows frequencies above the cutoff frequency to pass, cuts
off the lower frequencies.) works on mono and stereo audio.
<p>
Applied to white noise, this filter and the low pass filter with Q
can be used to
produce wind-like sounds, but only at a constant frequency.
