The sq1 sequencer generates complex sequences of tones by using the sum of
three square wave LFOs to frequency modulate two oscillators. The oscillators
output one of four waves (sine, tri, square and saw) and may be detuned
relative to each other. The wave tables are not band limited so aliasing
will result for sufficiently high frequencies.  There is also an overall three
stage amplitude envelope.

Parameters:
center	- The unmodulated carrier frequency in Hertz.
detune	- The frequency of oscillator 2 relative to oscillator 1
wave	- The wave selector. 0=sine, 1=tri, 2=square, 3=saw
          Both oscillators produce the same wave-shape.
attack	- Attack time in seconds.
sustain - Sustain time in seconds
decay   - Decay time in seconds
f1	- Frequency of LFO 1 in hertz
a1	- Amplitude of LFO 1
f2      - Frequency of LFO 2
a2      - Amplitude of LFO 2
f3	- Frequency of LFO 3
a3	- Amplitude of LFO 3

<p>
The three LFOs are interchangeable. Note that the LFO amplitudes are
calibrated in Hertz indicating the corresponding frequency shift in the audio
oscillators.
