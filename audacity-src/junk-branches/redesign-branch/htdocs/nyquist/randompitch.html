Random pitch Modulation
<p>
Randomly modulates the pitch of your audio. As with previous
randomly-controlled effects, the maximum speed (maxspeed) of the
random changes is adjustable (in Hz). Again, the lower maxspeed is,
the higher you must set the factor control to get the same depth of
randomness as with higher maxspeed settings.
<p>
Increasing warping depth gives you increasing pitch changes. A
fourth control, max pitch depth, is included. If the warping depth
is high enough, max depth should be made higher otherwise there
will be momentary periods of no pitch changes. With lower warping
settings, this does not happen, and the effect can be re-applied
repeatedly for further random pitch changes.
<p>
It's difficult to explain the workings of the controls, it's easier
to experiment and find out what happens.
<p>
This effect works on mono and stereo audio. In stereo, each channel
has different random pitch modulation applied.
