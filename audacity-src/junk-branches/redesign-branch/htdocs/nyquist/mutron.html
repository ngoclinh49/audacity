Loosely based on the Mutron stomp box from the late 70's. Basically it is an
envelope follower controlled filter. 
<p>
Center - sets un-modulated filter frequency.<br>
Depth - sets filter modulation depth either negative or positive.<br>
Band Width - Resonance control, lower values are more resonant.<br>
Mode - There are four filters:<br>
0 - Low pass<br>
1 - High pass<br>
2 - Band Reject<br>
3 - Band Pass<br>
