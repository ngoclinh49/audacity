* Delay with Pitch Shift
<p>
A delay plug-in except each delay is pitch shifted. Standard delay
variables: decay (in db), delay time (in seconds), and number of
delays. Also includes amount of pitch shift (from 0.1 to 10.0) and
selection of whether the pitch is to be multiplied (0) or divided
(1) by the shift number.

* tonedelay.ny: Delay with Tone Shift
<p>
Similar to pitchshift.ny except you can define in semitones how
much each delay is to be pitch shifted. A shift of 1 semitone means
each delay is increased in pitch by 1 semitone, a shift of -1 means
a decrease of 1 semitone. Includes whole semitones plus semitone
cents (hundredths of a semitone).
<p>
Warning! Both plug-ins are best applied to relatively short
duration audio, or few number of delays for longer audio. Otherwise
Audacity will be working a _long_ time. Same thing seems to happen
if there is already pitch shifting within the audio. (This all may
be simply my computer, which runs at 233MHz.)
