bugs.txt

This file is where we keep track of all known bugs
in Audacity. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs to fix:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Problems recording at other than 44100 Hz on Mac
- Recording at a rate other than 44100 works, but the
  track created has the wrong rate in its label
- Fix id3lib compilation problems on Linux
- Freeze when opening Prefs panel on MacOS 8.6
- Exporting using LAME does incorrect sample rate,
  or incorrect # of channels?  Maybe only with certain
  versions of LAME?
- Core dump when doing long recordings on Linux
- ID3 genre list doesn't fit in the window on Linux/GTK
- Fix underflow problems when recording (as much as
  possible) and try to report them if not
- Menu bar does not function when Prefs dialog is
  in front on MacOS
- Get rid of any "exit()" calls in snd/ or other
  libraries
- Use latest FreeVerb (3.0)
- Fix divide-by-zero bug in Envelope.cpp (can crash
  on Windows)
- (possibly Mac only?) Copy portion of file, paste into
  new project, save and close new project, CRASH!
  See email from TC Baker
- Link against libwx_gtk.so in RPM, and add instructions
  to ln -s /usr/lib/libwx_gtk-2.2.so /usr/lib/libwx_gtk.so

-----------------------------------------------------------
Possible bugs to investigate:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Exporting tracks with envelopes and an offset can result
  in different WAV output than what you see on the screen in
  the editor.  (See email from Mike Tyson).
- Linux: hit Undo lots of times in a row crashes.
  (Email from Daniel James)  Can't reproduce.
- Audacity is unstable when working with very large files
- Possible memory leak in Windows 98 (???)
  See emails from degarb@softhome.net
- Typing in the root directory as the Temp Files path
  doesn't work (on Mac OS X)?
- Problem reading AIFF files on Mac OS X?
  (Private email from Tobias Jeger - the attached
	AIFF file worked fine under Linux)
- Does "make install" create all of the directories
  it wants to installs into
- Audacity won't start under (some versions of?) MacOS 8.5,
  complains about InterfaceLib and SetAntiAliasedTextEnabled
- Test USB mics under Mac OS 9 (see email from J. Blucher)
- Closing track while recording (see Brian G's email on
  3/30/02)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Fixed, need to port:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Single instance checker (added to MSW only of 0.9
  branch, need to port to HEAD)
- Change menu item when you change export format
  (need to port to HEAD)
- Find VST folder on startup (need to port to HEAD)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Fixed:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Copy and Paste between projects
- Temp directory in Prefs dialog should have a "Chooose..."
  button to let you select a directory with a standard
  file dialog.
- RPM dependency is wrong - it should depend on:
  libwx_gtk-2.2.so.6, not libwx_gtk.so
  # Necessary for building the package: rpm -ba
    BuildRequires:	wxGTK >= [version number if required]i 
  # Necessary for installing the package: rpm -ivh
    Requires:	wxGTK >= [version number if required]
- Clicking close box only deletes one track of
  stereo pair
- Audacity "forgets" tracks' channels when saving/loading
- Needs to handle temp directory better - bring up a
  dialog if it's not there...
- Undoing an envelope edit sometimes causes problems
- Recording/Playback devices backwards on Windows
- Need to have a warning when you write over a file the
  project depends on - and an option to rename the file
  if necessary.
- Set Rate... dialog doesn't initialize with the
  current rate.  Sometimes 0, sometimes junk.
  (Note that there are two of these dialogs.)
- Better aRts support (or at least a warning???)
- Zoom tool shouldn't change selection
- Scrolling with the zoom tool shouldn't zoom.
- Closing a project window should throw away all blockfiles
  other than the ones in the last saved version.  (Implement
  this in conjunction with save changes dialogs.)
- Save As... for a project should work.
- Bug fixed: each track's channel was not being saved
  in the project file.
  (Was: stereo "linked" track that's really two mono tracks,
   Check upon opening project)
- Bug fixed: Must warn user if temp directory can't be created
  Now checks on startup and opens Prefs Dialog for user to fix.
- Bug fixed: Duplicate track doesn't work if track is shifted
  past zero.  Track selection and copying are now more aware
  of offsets.
- Filenames with a period outside the extension are truncated.
- "New..." menu item should be "New"
- Crash in NoiseRemoval effect on Windows.
- Shouldn't create envelope points outside the track range.
- Compiled id3lib for Windows version.
- Changed pthread_yield to sched_yield for portability.
