<font size=+3>

File Menu

</font>



<a name="new"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

New...

</b></font>



<p>Creates a new empty project window.



<a name="open"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Open...

</b></font>

<p>Selecting <i>Open</i> presents you with a dialog where you

can choose a file to open.  If the current project window

is empty, the new file will take over the current window,

otherwise a new project window will be opened.  The file formats

recognized by Audacity are

<a href="fileformats.htm#wav">WAV</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#aiff">AIFF</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#au">NeXT/AU</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#ircam">IRCAM</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#mp3">MP3</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#ogg">Ogg Vorbis</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#midi">MIDI</a>,

and the Audacity Project file format 

(<a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a>).

In addition, Audacity can also attempt to open an audio file in

a different format, as long as it is uncompressed - to do this,

use the <a href="menu4.htm#importraw">Import Raw Data</a> command.



<a name="close"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Close

</b></font>



<p>Closes the current project window.



<a name="save"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Save Project

</b></font>



<p>Saves the current Audacity project (<a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a>)

file.  Audacity projects are <i>not</i> intended to be read by other

programs, but they are extremely fast to load and save within Audacity.

When you are finished working on a project and you want to be able to

use it in another program, select one of the

<a href="#export">Export</a> commands instead.

Note that most of the audio data for an Audacity project is not

stored in the <a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a> file, but in a

directory (folder) with the same name as the project.  For example,

if you save a project as <tt>chanson.aup</tt>, there will be a directory

called <tt>chanson_data</tt> created to store the actual audio tracks

of the project.  For more information on the project file format,

see <a href="fileformats.htm#aup">the file formats page</a>.



<a name="saveas"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Save Project As...

</b></font>



<p>Saves the current Audacity project (<a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a>)

file, allowing you to give it a different name or move it to a new location

if you have already saved it in one location.

Audacity projects are <i>not</i> intended to be read by other

programs, but they are extremely fast to load and save within Audacity.

When you are finished working on a project and you want to be able to

use it in another program, select one of the <a href="#export">Export</a>

commands instead.

For more information on the project file format,

see <a href="fileformats.htm#aup">the file formats page</a>.



<a name="export"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Export As WAV...

</b></font>



<p>Exports the current Audacity project as a standard audio file format

such as 

<a href="fileformats.htm#wav">WAV</a> or 

<a href="fileformats.htm#aiff">AIFF</a>.

You can change the format of exported files in the

<a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a> dialog.

<p>

If there are multiple tracks of the same channel in your project,

they will be automatically mixed in the exported data.  For more

information about mixing, see

<a href="menu4.htm#quickmix">Quick Mix</a>.

To export only a single track or part of a track,

use <a href="#exportsel">Export Selection</a>.



<a name="exportsel"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Export Selection As WAV...

</b></font>



<p>This is the same as <a href="#export">Export</a>, but it only

exports the part of the project that is selected.  This is very

useful if you want to save a small clip from part of a track as

a separate file.







<a name="exportmp3"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Export As MP3...

</b></font>



<p>Exports the current Audacity project as an MP3 file.

Audacity does not encode MP3 files directly, but instead

requires that you download a separate MP3 encoder.

See <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a> for

details.

<p>



To export only a single track or part of track,

use <a href="#exportselmp3">Export Selection as MP3</a>.



<a name="exportselmp3"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Export Selection As WAV...

</b></font>



<p>This is the same as <a href="#exportmp3">Export MP3</a>, but it only

exports the part of the project that is selected.  This is very

useful if you want to save a small clip from part of a track as

a separate file.  See <a href="exportmp3.htm">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.



<a name="exportlabels"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Export Labels...

</b></font>



<p>If you have any <a href="tracks.htm#label">Label Tracks</a>, this

command will export them as a text file.  This feature is commonly

used in Speech Recognition research to annotate a speech utterance

and export the annotation to be later processed by another program.

To import these labels into a different project later, use the

<a href="menu4.htm#importlabels">Import Labels</a> command.

<a name="prefs"></a>



<p><font size=+0><b>

Preferences

</b></font>



<p>Opens a dialog window that lets you configure Audacity.

For more information on the different preferences, see

the section on <a href="prefs.htm">Audacity Preferences</a>.



<a name="exit"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Exit/Quit

</b></font>



<p>

Closes all project windows and exits Audacity.

This menu item does not ask you if you want to save changes,

so be careful not to select it by accident.  (When we release

version 1.0, it will ask you if you want to save changes.)
