Project Menu

</font>



<a name="import"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Import Audio...

</b></font>



<p>

This command is used to import audio from a standard audio format into

your project.  Use this command if you already have a couple of tracks,

and you want to add another track to the same project, maybe to mix

them together.

<p>

Use this command to import anything except MIDI files.

You cannot yet use this option to import Audacity Projects.



<a name="importlabels"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Import Labels...

</b></font>



<p>

This command takes a text file which contains time codes and labels,

and turns them into a 

<a href="tracks.htm#label>Label Track</a>.



<a name="importmidi"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Import MIDI...

</b></font>



<p>

This menu command imports MIDI files and puts them into a 

<a href="tracks.htm#note">Note Track</a>.  Audacity can display

MIDI files, but cannot play, edit, or save them yet.



<a name="importraw"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Import Raw Data...

</b></font>



<p>This menu command allows you to open a file in virtually any

format, as long as it is not compressed.  When you select the

file, Audacity will look through it and try to guess its format.

It will guess correctly about 90% of the time, so you can try just

pressing "OK" and listening to it.  If it is not correct, however,

you can use the dialog presented to try all of the different

possibilities.

<p>

At the beginning of your imported track(s), you may notice a little

bit of noise.  This is probably the file's header, which Audacity

was not able to parse.  Just zoom in and select the noise with the

<a href="toolbar.htm#selection">Selection Tool</a>, and then

choose <a href="menu2.htm#delete">Delete</a>.



<a name="editid3tags"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Edit ID3 Tags...

</b></font>



<p>

Opens a dialog allowing you to edit the ID3 tags associated with

a project, for MP3 exporting.

<p>

ID3 Tags are used to store the Title, Artist, Author, and other

information in MP3 files.  When you import an MP3 file,

Audacity remembers this information and stores it with your

project.  When you export an MP3 file, Audacity will prompt

you for the ID3 tags, showing you any tags it collected from

an original MP3 file, or that you typed by selecting

"Edit ID3 Tags" from the Project menu.

<p>

Audacity allows you to store ID3 tags in either the ID3v1 or

the ID3v2 format.  In general, you should use the ID3v2 format,

because ID3v2 tags go at the <i>beginning</i> of an MP3 file,

whereas ID3v1 tags go at the end.  Having the title and author

first means that someone downloading an MP3 you created will

know that information before they've finished downloading the

song. 



<a name="quickmix"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Quick Mix

</b></font>



<p>This command mixes all of the selected tracks down to one or two

tracks.  The channel of a track being mixed affects whether it

will be mixed into the left channel of the resulting track(s),

the right channel, or both (mono).  For example, if you have

four tracks:



<ul>

<li> Track 1: left channel

<li> Track 2: left channel

<li> Track 3: right channel

<li> Track 4: mono channel

</ul>



and you select them all and perform a Quick Mix, you will end up

with two tracks: the first will contain a mix of tracks 1, 2, and 4

(the new left channel) and the other will contain a mix of tracks

3 and 4 (the new right channel).



<p>



Your tracks are implicitly mixed whenever you hit the

<a href="toolbar.htm#play">Play</a> 

button and whenever you select 

<a href="menu1.htm#export">Export</a>.



<p>



Note that if you try to mix two very loud tracks together, you may

get clipping (it will sound like pops, clicks, and noise).  To avoid

this, you should first use the Amplify... command to reduce the amplitude

of all of your tracks.  A future version of Audacity will do automatic

gain control and calculate the optimal amplitude for you.



<a name="aligntogether"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Align Tracks Together

</b></font>



<p>If you select multiple tracks, this command adjusts their time offset

so that they start at the same time.  It adjusts their starting time

to the average of all of the tracks' original starting times.

To adjust the time offset of a track, use the 

<a href="toolbar.htm#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool.



<a name="alignzero"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Align with Zero

</b></font>



<p>If you select multiple tracks, this command resets their time offset

to zero.

To adjust the time offset of a track, use the 

<a href="toolbar.htm">Time Shift</a> tool.



<a name="newaudiotrack"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

New Audio Track

</b></font>



<p>This creates a new empty audio track.  This command is rarely needed,

since importing, recording, and mixing automatically create new tracks

as needed.  But you can use this to cut or copy data from an existing

track and paste it into a blank track.



<a name="newlabeltrack"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

New Label Track

</b></font>



<p>This creates a new Label track, which can be very useful for

textual annotation.  See the discussion on 

<a name="tracks.htm#label">Label tracks</a> for more information

on how to use label tracks.



<a name="remove"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Remove Track(s)

</b></font>



<p>This command removes the selected track or tracks from the project.

Even if only part of a track is selected, the entire track is removed.

You can also delete a track by clicking the X in its upper-left corner.

To cut out only part of the audio in a track, use

<a href="menu1.htm#delete">Delete</a> or 

<a href="menu1.htm#silence">Silence</a>.
