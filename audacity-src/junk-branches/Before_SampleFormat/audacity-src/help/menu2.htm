Undo

</b></font>

you can undo every editing operation back to the last time the

document was saved.



<a name="redo"></a>

<p><font size=+0><b>

Redo

</b></font>



<p>This will redo any editing operations that were just undone.

After you perform a new editing operation, including simply

resizing a track, you can no longer redo the operations that

were undone.
