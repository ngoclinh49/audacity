todo.txt

This is the file where we keep track of all feature
requests and plans, and organize them by which
release they're going in.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Website / Sourceforge
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Get announcement list running
- Instructions for LAMELib or .sit archive
- Upload some icons for people to use with
  KDE, GNOME, WindowMaker, AfterStep, BlackBox...
- Note on website that Audacity is incompatible
  with Norton Protected Recycle Bin (see email
  from Josef Ravenscroft)

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.0 / Audacity 0.9 branch
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Address all bugs in "bugs.txt"
- Add more keyboard shortcuts and "nudge" commands
- Make Audacity compile on Unix even if dlopen is
  not supported (work around wxGTK 2.2.9 bug where
  it can't be found)
- Experiment with much larger recording buffers - does
  latency suffer?  Do we care?  Does it result in fewer
  underflows?
- Test the "instant stop" on Windows and Mac.  Should
  it be used for recording, too?
- Bug on Linux: hold down spacebar to keep playing/stopping,
  gets in endless loop...
- Support MP3 exporting at even lower bitrates
- Select region by typing in start and stop times

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.1.1 / HEAD
-----------------------------------------------------------

Unit tests:
- Need to verify that the new 1.0 mixing code plays every
  sample one and only once.

Audio:
- Multiple sample formats (16-bit, float as a minimum)
- Choice of dither
- Pre-roll and post-roll: amount to play before and after
  a selection (see DG Malham email)
- Latency control in Audio I/O prefs
- Playthrough (definitely on Mac OS, maybe on others?)

UI::
- While playing, click in ruler to change playback
  position
- Remember window size and position
- Import... should be able to import Audacity projects
  and Audacity project files
- Crash recovery
- Clean up a project directory upon open
- Make "Exit program upon closing last window" an option
  in the Preferences.  (The alternative would be to create
  a new empty project when you close the last window.)
- Out of disk space checks
- Nudge selection with arrow keys
- Make all keyboard shortcuts configurable
- Make colors configurable
- Adapt text color - should be white by default if
  the background color is very dark
- Select dialog box ("1.5 - 3.0 seconds")
  and allow selection by frames (24 frames/sec), samples, etc.
- Show selection (i.e. zoom such that the selection fits)
- Invert selection (for now, until we allow discontiguous selections,
                    this should mean two options: select up to selection,
                    and select after selection)
- Zero Crossings (nudge selection to nearest ZC's)
- Finish history window
- Vertical zooming
- Pan control for each track
- Volume control for each track
- Trim (= opposite of delete -- delete all but selection)
- Vertical bar indicating playback/recording position, too
- Add high-quality resampling
- Legend (Ruler) for pitch and spectrum
- Recognize .mp2, .mpg, .mpeg as libmad-capable files
- Plug-ins should be split into many separate menus on Linux/GTK
  (if you have lots of them)
- Envelope editor should support linear, quadratic, and exponential,
  ideally with a right-click.  Default should be linear; it makes the
  most sense visually.
- Some way to insert silence with the mouse???
- Looping - two forms of looping:
  * An option to continuously loop the selection during playback
    (maybe a "loop" checkbox under the Play button)
  * A way to turn a track into a loop.  It would be cool if the
    display showed the "real" waveform once, and then "ghosts" of
    that waveform repeating forever...
- Drag the play marker in the ruler to "skip" to a new time
   
Import/Export
- Import latest libsndfile; finish exporting code
- Rewrite the Import Raw Data... code
- Command-line LAME exporting

Effects::
- Show spectrum in FFT filter
- Add preview button to all effects dialogs
- Freeverb 3.0 (and better interface)
- Pitch/tempo change
- Smart Mix (like Quick Mix but guarantees no clipping)
- Cross-fade (smooth between two tracks)
- Compressor/Limiter/Expander
- Native port of Freeverb (ideally optimized)
- EQ
- Auto find track boundaries
- Pop/click removal
- Save VST plug-in parameters to a file, or at least
  remember the last settings

-----------------------------------------------------------
Future:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Speed issues when you have a project of 5 or more tracks
- Edit markers
- Ability to drag tracks instead of move down, move down, move down
- "Fit in window" also works vertically
- Better adaptation to different font sizes (sizers)
- Move to lossless compression (FLAC?) for internal representation
- allow labels to contain selections, which would be activated by clicking
  on the label
- discontiguous selection
- visualization window: VU meters, equalizer, continuous waveform, oscilloscope
- Scrubbing

Low level issues::
- support multi-track I/O
- support an arbitrary number of channels
- Make projects one big file
