<P class=qr>What is Reverb ?</P>
<P class=a>
 A Reverb simulates the component of sound that results from reflections from surrounding walls or objects.
 It is in effect a room simulator. Some peope think it's just a delay effect with some filters, but it's way
 more complex than that. Reverb effects (software plugins or external hardware units) provide
 an interface to their changable parameters that need some explaining. Let's look at a simple room first.
</P>
<P class=qr>Basic Simulation of a Room</P>
<P class=a>
 <B>Our model is a simple room</B> with four straight walls, a sound source and a listener. In <i>Figure 1</i>
 the arrows stand for the path of travelling sound.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The listener hears the DIRECT signal first. The DIRECT signal is also referred to as the DRY part of the signal when using
 any effect. Most digital reverbs produce two parts: The Early Reflections and the Reverb component.
</P>

  The first Early Reflection reaches the listener milliseconds after
  the direct signal does.

  The path of the Early Reflections is longer. The difference in time between the arrival of
  the direct signal and the first Early Reflections is measured in milliseconds.

  <U><B>Predelay</B></U><BR>
  The time between the reception of the DIRECT signal by the listener and start of the Reverb portion
  of the effect is called <B>Predelay</B>. This is a parameter in many digital reverb effects, and it
  is expressed in milliseconds (ms).
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  <U><B>Reverb Time</B></U><BR>
  The time difference between switching off any sound generator and the level of the reverb resulting
  from that sound dropping by 60dB is called <B>RT60</B>.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  This is usualy referred to as the <B>Reverb Time</B>. When anyone refers to the reverb time
  of a real room or that of a digital reverb, RT60 is what they're talking about.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  Most digital reverbs feature this as a parameter.

 Here we have the Hishelf and Lowshelf EQs for Damping(left) and for the final output(right). The upper middle display
 depicts the Early Reflections placement and level, as well as the Reverb portion start and fading. Above this display
 is the <i>Reverb Type</i> selector. This changes the placement and level of the Early Reflections. The <i>Size</i> slider
 has influence on the Early Reflections as well.
</P>

<!-- P class=a>
 The surface of a wall as well as different shapes and sizes of objects in a room influence
 the way sound reflects, bends or spreads from off them.
</P -->
<P class=a>
 Blank concrete will reflect sound quite well across the frequency spectrum. A large thick curtain
 or padded walls will reflect sound poorly. A large club filled with people sounds completly different
 from an empty one. People, comfy chairs, curtains, carpets, beds and many more objects reflect only
 part of the sound that hits them.
</P>



<P class=qr>An example by the numbers</P>

<P class=a>
 As an example I'd like to show you how to create a reverb for small club
 with a band.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Let's see what we have to do with parameters in the reverb fx in sample
 editors. First we determine some basics about the room we want to simulate.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Our room(the club) is about eight meters on all sides(for simplicity)
 and three meters high. The band will be playing no more than four meters
 away from us. The room volume will be about 200 cubic meters.
</P>
<P class=a>
 This means that the DIRECT SOUND will get to you within about
 11 ms (milliseconds). This is the amount of time we'll need to take off the other values.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The first EARLY REFLECTIONS (off the left and right walls) travel
 around nine meters before reaching you, so they'll get to your ears about
 15 ms later! (9 meters at 343 meters/sec -> 26 ms minus the 11 ms the DIRECT
 SOUND takes to travel to your ears).
</P>
<P class=a>
 I'm not taking the floor into account because of the obstacles, such as your
 own legs and a table, that prevent reflections of sound from the band from
 reaching you. It is also probable that your sitting close to a wall and
 EARLY REFLECTION time may drop considerably. Experiment and listen very
 carefully.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The reason I'm deducting 11 ms from the 26 ms is that in a sample editor
 we already have the DIRECT SOUND.
 In Cool Edit an EARLY REFLECTIONS parameter doesn't exist. In Soundforge
 however there are a few ER times to choose from. We choose whatever is
 closest to 15 ms. Freeverb unfortunatly does not have an Early Reflections
 feature.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Please note that the timing of the EARLY REFLECTIONS are defined by the
 rooms characteristics such as shape and size. The sound colour of the
 EARLY REFLECTIONS is defined by the surfaces in the room.These are parameters
 that are available to professional reverbs only(hard- or software), so don't
 worry about not finding that stuff in great detail in either Soundforge's,
 CoolEditPro's or plugins of other editors.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The PRE-DELAY and REVERB TIME depend on more than just room size.
 Wall and floor material, as well as anything else that reflects, disperses
 and dampens sound will influence the reverb in quite a few ways.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Our club has lots of wood on it's walls and floor and people are sitting
 at tables and the air's probably filled with a little smoke(except in
 California :).
</P>
<P class=a>
 The REVERB TIME, a parameter found in almost all plugins, should be set to
 no more than one second. In small, crowded rooms where little REVERB occurs
 it is quite important to set the EARLY REFLECTIONS right. Experiment with
 the reverb time keep it lower than 1.2 seconds and above 0.7 seconds.
 Freeverb puts all this information in to the SIZE parameter.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The PRE-DELAY can be set to 30 ms or more. Larger rooms will develop REVERB
 later since the reflecting sound will travel a while before the reflections
 become hard to identify but it also depends on the reflecting materials.
 Freeverb once again doesn't know any Predelays, but since you're reading this
 to learn how things work, it's still worth spelling out.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Both Cool Edit and Soundforge have parameters referring to the DENSITY of the
 REVERB part of the sound. Materials such as polished marble will reflect the
 sound very well and disperse the sound very little. Wood disperses the sound
 a lot and a carpet practically swallows a large chunk of it.
 For our Club we need to set the density high since our material disperses the
 sound a lot(humans,wood and obstacles). No parameter like that in Freeverb and
 yet it sounds great. It's easy to use as well, so I don't realy mind when using it.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Higher frequencies are swallowed a lot faster than low frequencies.
 Many reverb algorythems refer to this in some form or another. Cool Edit
 has the 'High Frequency Absorbtion Time' as a parameter for this.
 Sound Forge gives you a choice, whether to do this at all for both low and
 high frequencies and even lets you set them but doesn't provide any time
 parameters. Professional Reverb hardware such as Lexicon PCM 70,80&90 let you
 you control frequency and time of this, for low and high frequencies.
 Freeverb has the DAMPEN parameter for this.
</P>
<P class=a>
 This can effectivly add to room's liveliness. A room full of people will
 absorb high frequencies a lot faster than an empty room, in which only the
 materials would make the difference, so in Cool Edit we'll set the 'High
 Frequency Absorbtion Time' very low, since we're in a crowded club.
 For Soundforge activate the 'Attenuate high frequencies above' box and set
 the frequency parameter to around 2000-2500 Hz. Experiment a bit. The higher
 this frequeny and the longer the Absorbtion Time parameter in Cool Edit,
 the emptier and and colder your room will seem. In small rooms this can
 cause the room to sound very metallic. Sewer pipes and oil pipelines e.g.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The Reverb EQs are the final processing stage and can change the sound
 dramatically. These Hishelf and Lowshelf EQs are found in almost ANY
 Reverb plugin and hardware unit. Freeverb has both in form of Hipass and
 Lowpass filters. These are not EQs. The parameters change the target
 frequencies of the filters. Again, listen.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The last thing you have to do is set the balance between the WET signal
 and your original DRY signal. Here you can do as you please but remember
 that only very smoothed hard surfaces in big cavernous space create very loud
 reverbs. A church might do that if there aren't a big number of people and
 wooden benches in there, but a club doesn't :). Remember that in Audacity
 it is smarter to DUPLICATE the part you wish to add reverb to, and run the
 effect over that duplicate. The volume of that reverbed material is easier
 to control, so set the WET parameter in Freeverb to 0dB(->100%) and the
 DRY parameter to -endless(->0% left most slider position).
</P>
<P class=a>
 So when you create your next 'soon-to-be-the-hit' song or want to put things
 in perspective, be sure to check the possibilities of adding dimension and
 scope to your material through clever use of reverbs.
 Put your snare to the front, the piano a little to the back, and the sax
 just a little in front of the drums. Experiment. With these basics you'll
 be able to get better results in less time.
</P>
<P class=a>
 Btw, Snare always gets reverb. How much and what kind up to you, but it's a
 generaly good thing. It's also important to decide whether you're trying to
 simulate a real live band or doing a multitrack sound, which boasts all kinds
 of nice ideas, like doubling(another take of the same thing on top of the
 first take), extreme panning and in general NOT reality :).
