TwoLAME TODO List
=================

- not sure if encode_frame() in toolame.c is correct
    frame of mpeg1 is only 576 samples, not 1152 ?

- use Exact-width integer types (eg uint16_t)

- add twolame_get_framesize()

- use 32-bit floats internally where possible
    
- Add more feedback to frontend
    - Total number of frames while encoding
    - Duration, filesize and compression ratios in print_file_config

- Add libresample support to libtoolame (toolame_set_in_samplerate etc.)
- parameter checking in toolame.c using assert
- full options sanity checking/verification in toolame_init_params
- Create a new toolame.spec (be sure to include twolame.pc)
- quite a lot of duplicated code between toolame_encode_buffer_interleaved
  and toolame_encode_buffer
- sort out changing parameter for toolame_set_VBR_q from FLOAT to int (like LAME)
- sort out num_ancillary_bits issues in libtwolame (should not be in front end?)
- better use of verbosity settings

- don't allow twolame_set_* after twolame_init_params() has been called

- with this VBR mode, we know the bits aren't going to run out, so we can 
  just assign them "greedily".
- VBR_a_bit_allocation() is yet to be written :)

- Sort out tab size / space mixture in source files
  (my preference is to use spaces - where a tab is 4 spaces)

- Add a layer 2 decoder ? mpglib ?

- Fix broken energy level support
- Fix broken DAB support
- Possible buffer overrun in new_extension() ?
