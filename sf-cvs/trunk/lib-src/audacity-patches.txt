This is intended as a list of all the patches that have been incorporated into
the lib-src copies of libraries, to avoid them getting lost in version upgrades
from upstream, and to remind us of the versions we are using.

Libraries
=========
allegro
-------

dlcompat
--------
Support library for dynamic loading of modules on OS X 10.3 and older. Used
for LADSPA on OS X support, and probably not any where else

expat
-----

system copy is prefered over this one, even on OS X (where it is shipped by
default)

FileDialogue
------------
The customised file saving dialogues for wxwidgets to provide the options
button for format preferences. This is written and maintianed by us so doesn't
have and upstream at the moment.

iAVC
----
disused?

id3lib
------
disused?

libflac
-------
http://flac.sourceforge.net/

Crib notes on upgrading lib-src trees:
======================================
1 Remove old files
------------------
find . -not -wholename '*CVS*' -delete
will remove all the source files but not any directories or the CVS files, so
after this you have an empty place into which you can unpack the new tarball

2 Bring in new files
--------------------
Next unpack the tarball. If you want to unpack within a package directory,
then tar --strip-components 1 will remove the un-needed top level directory.

3 Apply patches and updates
---------------------------
Now we have a new file tree. This is the point at which to clean out any
un-needed files, re-apply any local patches so on.

* run autoreconf if we have modified configure.in or configure.ac
* run libtoolize --copy --force to update ltmain.sh, config.sub, config.guess

By doing it this way we have already updated the mtime on all files, so we
don't need to do a recusive touch.

4 Add new files to CVS and remove old ones
------------------------------------------
CVS will list files with a ? if they are new and need to be added to the
repository. To get a list, run 
cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep '?'
Finding which files have been removed is a bit harder:
cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep 'Status: Needs Checkout'
gives file names but not their paths, so you have to go back and grep each
file name to find them and do cvs rm on them.

5 Commit the lot to CVS
-----------------------
Run cvs ci -f -R to commit all the files in the new library tree. Use an
appropriate message that says what library version this is. This should do
all the required changes and add / remove files.
