This is intended as a list of all the patches that have been incorporated into
the lib-src copies of libraries, to avoid them getting lost in version upgrades
from upstream, and to remind us of the versions we are using.

Libraries
=========
dlcompat
--------
Support library for dynamic loading of modules on OS X 10.3 and older. Used
for LADSPA on OS X support, and probably not any where else

expat
-----
XML parser library used to parse project files and so on. By default the
system copy is prefered over this one, even on OS X (where it is shipped by
default). Build against system 2.0.1 works fine.
Version in audacity CVS: 1.2
Patches: None
Upstream version: 2.0.1

FileDialogue
------------
The customised file saving dialogues for wxwidgets to provide the options
button for format preferences. This is written and maintained by us so doesn't
have an upstream at the moment.

iAVC
----
disused?

id3lib
------

	asm-textreloc.patch. Patch from Gentoo to avoid text relocations is
		the assembly optimisations. In upstream CVS
	asneeded.patch. Add LDFLAGS needed for non-glibc systems. Taken from Gentoo.

Crib notes on upgrading lib-src trees:
======================================
1 Remove old files
------------------
find . -not -wholename '*CVS*' -delete
will remove all the source files but not any directories or the CVS files, so
after this you have an empty place into which you can unpack the new tarball

2 Bring in new files
--------------------
Next unpack the tarball. If you want to unpack within a package directory,
then tar --strip-components 1 will remove the un-needed top level directory.

3 Apply patches and updates
---------------------------
Now we have a new file tree. This is the point at which to clean out any
un-needed files, re-apply any local patches so on. To clean up after patching,
run  find . -name '*.orig' -delete and  find . -name '*~' -delete. To remove
.svn directories from projects that use SVN upstream, use
find . -wholename '*/.svn/*' -delete and then find . -name '.svn' -delete

* run autoreconf if we have modified configure.in or configure.ac
* run libtoolize --copy --force to update ltmain.sh, config.sub, config.guess

By doing it this way we have already updated the mtime on all files, so we
don't need to do a recusive touch.

4 Add new files to CVS and remove old ones
------------------------------------------
CVS will list files with a ? if they are new and need to be added to the
repository. To get a list, run 
cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep '?'
Remember to ignore the generated files from the build system which don't need
to be included in CVS, like aclocal.m4 and autom4te.cache

Finding which files have been removed is a bit harder:
cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep 'Status: Needs Checkout'
gives file names but not their paths, so you have to go back and grep each
file name to find them and do cvs rm on them.

To remove all the files that are in the working directory but aren't under CVS
control, you can use this incantation:
\rm $(cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep '?' | cut -d '?' -f 2)

5 Commit the lot to CVS
-----------------------
Run cvs ci -f -R to commit all the files in the new library tree. Use an
appropriate message that says what library version this is. This should do
all the required changes and add / remove files.
