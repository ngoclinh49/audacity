========================================================================

See "compile.txt" for how to build the executables.

There are currently two types of release builds for Windows, contained 
in the MSVC project configurations Release (for Windows 98/ME) and 
Unicode_Release (for 2000/XP/Vista). These instructions apply for 
either one, but example values are for Unicode_Release. 

1. Build the release executable. It's a good idea to not only do a 
	Build > Clean Solution 	beforehand, but to also delete the 
	directory (e.g., audacity\win\unicode_release).
	When you build, make sure to build the "locale" project, either 
	separately or as part of Build > Batch Build. 


2. Copy other necessities to release build folder.

	a. Copy the audacity\nyquist and audacity\plug-ins folders to 
		the build folder, e.g., audacity\win\unicode_release.
		Don't copy the hidden CVS subfolders.
	
	b. We are still keeping some of the LADSPA plug-ins in the 
		Audacity installer, so build these via the 
		audacity\win\LADSPA_plugins-win project, or if there's 
		no new code version for them, get them from a previous 
		install, and copy them to the plug-ins folder 
		(e.g., audacity\win\unicode_release\plug-ins):
		
		* gverb_1216.dll
		* hard_limiter_1413.dll
		* sc4_1882.dll
	
	<Not including Help file for 1.3.4, so no instructions 
		for that.>


3. Build the Installer.

	a. Install the latest Inno Setup 
		(http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

	b. Open the appropriate Inno Setup script, 
		audacity\win\audacity.iss for Release or 
		audacity\win\audacity_unicode.iss for Unicode_Release. 
		
	c. Change the version strings as necessary. 
		These are current for Unicode_Release:
	
		* OutputBaseFilename=audacity-win-unicode-1.3.4
		
		* AppName=Audacity 1.3 Beta (Unicode)
			For stable releases, this should just be 
			"Audacity (Unicode)"
		
		* AppVerName=Audacity 1.3.4 (Unicode)
		
		* DefaultDirName={pf}\Audacity 1.3 Beta (Unicode)
			For stable releases, this should just be 
			"Audacity (Unicode)"
	
	d. Compile and test the installer. 
		The result appears in audacity\win\Output.

	e. Rename it as necessary, e.g., 
		"audacity-win-unicode-1.3.4rc0.1.exe".


4. To create the zip version, go to the installed version, 
	e.g., "C:\Program Files\Audacity 1.3 Beta (Unicode)", 
	and remove the unins*.* files, then zip and rename that folder.
