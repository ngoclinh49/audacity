========================================================================

See "compile.txt" for how to build the executables.

There are currently two types of release builds for Windows, contained 
in the MSVC project configurations Release (for Windows 98/ME) and 
Unicode_Release (for 2000/XP/Vista). These instructions apply for 
either one, but example values are for Unicode_Release. 

1. Build the release executable. 

	a. Make sure you have got a current source version from CVS.
	
	b. Make sure to turn off ASIO support (see compile.txt) if you are 
		creating the installer for public release. 
		We cannot publicly post a build that supports ASIO, for 
		licensing reasons (more detail in compile.txt). 

	c. It's a good idea to not only do a Build > Clean Solution
		beforehand, but to also delete the directory 
		(e.g., audacity\win\unicode_release).
	
	d. Make sure to build the "locale" project, either 
		separately or as part of Build > Batch Build. You will need
		msgfmt.zip in your PATH for that. Get it from
		http://audacity.sourceforge.net/files/msgfmt.zip


2. Copy other necessities to release build folder.

	a. We are still keeping some of the LADSPA plug-ins in the 
		Audacity installer, even though we are now offering a 
		separate installer that includes all the LADSPA plug-ins 
		built from version 0.4.15. These are the ones we include

		* gverb_1216.dll
		* hard_limiter_1413.dll
		* sc4_1882.dll
		
		Check "http://plugin.org.uk/" for updates. 
		If none, just grab the dlls from a previous release. 
		If updated, build these via the 
		audacity\win\LADSPA_plugins-win project (see 
		audacity\win\LADSPA_plugins-win\readme_LADSPA_plugins-win.txt). 
		
		Once you have these DLL files, put them in the plug-ins 
		folder, e.g., audacity\win\unicode_release\plug-ins.

   b. Copy the audacity\LICENSE.txt and audacity\README.txt files
      to the build folder.

3. Get the manual

	Make sure you have python installed and on your path.
	Delete audacity\help\manual if it exists.
	Go to audacity\scripts\mw2html_audacity.
	Run wiki2htm and wait for it to complete.
	The manual should have been built in audacity\help\manual.

4. Build the Installer.

	a. Install the latest Inno Setup 
		(http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

	b. Open the appropriate Inno Setup script, 
		audacity\win\audacity.iss for Release or 
		audacity\win\audacity_unicode.iss for Unicode_Release. 
		
	c. Change the version strings as necessary. 
		These are current for Unicode_Release:
	
		* OutputBaseFilename=audacity-1.3.8-win-unicode
		
		* AppName=Audacity 1.3 Beta (Unicode)
			For stable releases, this should just be 
			"Audacity (Unicode)"
		
		* AppVerName=Audacity 1.3.8 (Unicode)
		
		* DefaultDirName={pf}\Audacity 1.3 Beta (Unicode)
			For stable releases, this should just be 
			"Audacity (Unicode)"
	
	d. Compile and test the installer. 
		The result appears in audacity\win\Output.

	e. Rename it as necessary, e.g., 
		"audacity-1.3.8rc0.1-win-unicode.exe".


5. To create the zip version, go to the installed version, 
	e.g., "C:\Program Files\Audacity 1.3 Beta (Unicode)", 
	and remove the unins*.* files, then zip and rename that folder.
