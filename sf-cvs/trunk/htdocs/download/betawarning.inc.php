  <?=_("Audacity 1.3 is an unstable, beta version of Audacity.  Users who want a completely stable, finished program should be using Audacity 1.2.  Audacity 1.3 has hundreds of new features, but some features may be incomplete or confusing, it is more likely to crash, and you are more likely to lose data.  You can install both Audacity 1.2 and 1.3 on the same machine, if you install them to different directories.")?></p>
