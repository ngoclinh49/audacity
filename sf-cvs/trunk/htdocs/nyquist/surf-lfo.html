surf-lfo.ny: LFO Surf generator 
<p>
LFO: low frequency oscillator. A signal whose frequency is
below the human ear's ability to hear as a tone,
generally below 20 cycles per second [Hertz or hz].
<p>
Generates mono or stereo surf which sweeps between a lower and
upper filter frequency. Stereo surf also sweeps back-and-forth
somewhere between the left and right audio channels.
<p>
To generate stereo surf, first open a blank stereo track [alt+p, s
in Audacity pre-1.3, alt+t, n, s in 1.3 and later]. Open the
generate menu. Click on 'Surf [LFO]'.
<p>
Variables with instructions:
<p>
1. Mono or stereo surf [1=mono 2=stereo]<br>
Mono surf is heard only in the center between the two speakers, or
in the middle of your head when wearing headphones. Stereo surf
also sweeps back-and-forth somewhere between the two audio
channels, depending on the next setting, Stereo Spread.
<p>
2. Stereo spread [stereo only: percent]<br>
The larger this value, the more widely the stereo surf will move
back-and-forth between the left and right audio channels. 
When this value is above zero, the deeper section of the surf sweep
will be heard more in the left channel; below zero, the deeper
section of the surf sweep will be heard mor in the right channel.
<p>
3. Fade-in and fade-out times [seconds]<br>
To smoothly fade in and fade out the volume at the start and end of
the surf.
<p>
4. Surf duration [minutes]<br>
Up to sixty minutes of LFO surf.
<p>
5. Surf type [0=white noise 1=pink noise]<br>
White noise is more of a 'hissing' sound, whereas pink noise is a
lower 'rushing' sound.
Technically, white noise is 'equal energy per frequency', whereas
pink noise is 'equal energy per octave'.
<p>
6. Surf sweep frequency [hz]<br>
Sets how slow or fast the surf sweeps between the lower and upper
filter frequencies, and the left and right channels [for stereo
surf].
<p>
The next two variables<br>
7. Lower filter frequency [hz]<br>
8. Upper filter frequency [hz]<br>
determine how low and how high the lowpass filter sweeps the surf
noise.
<p>
9. Bass frequency to boost [hz]<br>
You can boost [increase the volume of] frequencies of the surf
sound below this setting, to get a deeper-sounding surf. Somewhat
analogous to the bass knob on your stereo.
<p>
10. Bass boost [db]<br>
Sets how much to boost the above bass frequency. 0db means no
boost, 6db means double the amplitude of the bass frequency, and so
on.
<p>
<i>Note</i>
<p>
If you get an error message 'Nyquist returned too many audio
channels', this means you tried to generate stereo surf without
first having opened a blank stereo track in audacity. See
instructions at the start of this help file for instructions on how
to do this.
