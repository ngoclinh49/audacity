The Audacity developers have been busy with many new features over  
the past year.  We're pleased to announce
<a href=\"/download/features-1.3-a\">Audacity 1.3.2 (beta)</a>, which
contains dozens of new features and capabilities.  Because it is a work
in progress and does not yet come with complete documentation or translations
into foreign languages, it is recommended for more advanced users.
For all users, <a href=\"/download\">Audacity 1.2.5</a>
is a minor bug-fix update that addresses some problems with Audacity 1.2.4,
but does not add any significant new features.
It is complete and fully documented.  You can have
both Audacity 1.2.5 and 1.3.2 installed simultaneously.
Also, we have just made available a set of 92
<a href=\"/download/plugins\">LADSPA plug-ins for Windows</a>
