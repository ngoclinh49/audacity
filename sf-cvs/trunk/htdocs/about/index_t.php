  echo _('<h3>About Free Software</h3>

<p>Audacity is free software, developed by a group of volunteers and distributed under the <a href="license">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.</p>

<p>Free software is not just free of cost (like &quot;free beer&quot;).  It is <b>free as in freedom</b> (like &quot;free speech&quot;).  Free software gives you the freedom to use a program, study how it works, improve it and share it with others.  For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Programs like Audacity are also called <b>open source software</b>, because their source code is available for anyone to study or use.  There are thousands of other free and open source programs, including the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox</a> web browser, the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> office suite and entire Linux-based operating systems such as <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<p>We welcome <a href="../community/donate">donations</a> to support Audacity development.</p>');

echo _('<p><a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/59">Ohloh</a> has statistics on the value of Audacity development. The Ohloh &quot;badge&quot; at the bottom of each page on this site shows updated summary values. We set up the Ohloh pages about Audacity so the statistics show only the values of Audacity-specific development, excluding the third-party code libraries Audacity uses.</p>');

  echo _('<h3>Bundling, Reselling, or Distributing Audacity</h3>

<p>Vendors are free to bundle Audacity with their products, or to sell or distribute copies of Audacity (see <a href="../download/bundlers">Vendors and Distributors of Audacity</a>) under the <a href="license">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in distributing Audacity, please see the <a href="../about/license">License, and Advice for Vendors and Distributors</a> page.</p>');
