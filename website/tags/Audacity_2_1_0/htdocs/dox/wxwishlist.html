<h1><a class="anchor" id="WxWishList">WX Wish List </a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" id="WxWishlistIntro">
Introduction</a></h2>
<p>We're using this section to record requests for enhancements to wxWidgets. It's here in the documentation on the source code, because it indicates issues we have 'worked around' which we'd like a cleaner solution to.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WxWishlistTransparency">
Transparency, Masks, Alpha, wxImages and wxBitmaps</a></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, wxWidgets support for alpha-channel based transparency is patchy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for masks, that is all or nothing transparency, is excellent.</li>
<li>Support for alpha channel transparency, that is where values between 0 and 255 let some but not all of the background show through, is incomplete. It seems to be best supported on Windows, and least well supported on Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mask based transparency leads to sharp edges that look blocky and 'dated' on modern PC's - so we try to use alpha blending when we need transparency .</p>
<p>Support for alpha blending in wxImage and wxBitmap is different.</p>
<ul>
<li>wxImage is a platform neutral image. There are nice functions for loading and saving PNGs with transparency to or from a wxImage. These work on all platforms we use.</li>
<li>wxBitmap is a platform specific 'image'. To display an image it must at some point be converted to a wxBitmap.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a 32 bit wxBitmap has 24 bits for RGB and 8 bits for alpha. Under WindowsXP you can paste wxBitmaps into a wxMemDc and preserve the alpha channel. However, when you convert to a wxImage, unless you use an undocumented function which only works on WindowsXP, you lose it. To output a wxBitmap to a file you have to convert to a wxImage.</p>
<p>The workarounds for the incomplete alpha-channel support can be found in <a class="el" href="_image_manipulation_8cpp.html">ImageManipulation.cpp</a> . Also, in implementing <a class="el" href="themability.html">Themability</a> we keep both wxImages and wxBitmaps to work around the conversion problems.</p>
<p>So, the wishlist item is for wxWidgets to sort this out!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WxWishlistTreebook">
wxTreeBook</a></h2>
<p>We know a wxTreeBook is coming in wxWidgets 2.7.0. We're using a contrib-version that works pretty well, but using it as if it were a wxListBook. We've tried using wxWidgets 2.6.3 undocumented versions of wxChoiceBook and wxListBook, and in 2.6.3, neither is ready for prime time.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to having a built in wxTreeBook.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WxWishlist">
Docking And Layout System</a></h2>
<p>There are contrib directories that have partial implementations of Toolbar docking and layout. Our own system is rather hacked together, and just about meets our needs. We'd like a full strength system built in to wxWidgets. </p>
