Introduction</a></h2>
We're using this section to record requests for enhancements to wxWidgets. It's here in the documentation on the source code, because it indicates issues we have 'worked around' which we'd like a cleaner solution to.<h2><a class="anchor" name="WxWishlistTransparency">
Transparency, Masks, Alpha, wxImages and wxBitmaps</a></h2>
At the time of writing, wxWidgets support for alpha-channel based transparency is patchy.<p>
<ul>
<li>Support for masks, that is all or nothing transparency, is excellent.</li><li>Support for alpha channel transparency, that is where values between 0 and 255 let some but not all of the background show through, is incomplete. It seems to be best supported on Windows, and least well supported on Mac.</li></ul>
<p>
Mask based transparency leads to sharp edges that look blocky and 'dated' on modern PC's - so we try to use alpha blending when we need transparency .<p>
Support for alpha blending in wxImage and wxBitmap is different.<p>
<ul>
<li>wxImage is a platform neutral image. There are nice functions for loading and saving PNGs with transparency to or from a wxImage. These work on all platforms we use.</li><li>wxBitmap is a platform specific 'image'. To display an image it must at some point be converted to a wxBitmap.</li></ul>
<p>
Now, a 32 bit wxBitmap has 24 bits for RGB and 8 bits for alpha. Under WindowsXP you can paste wxBitmaps into a wxMemDc and preserve the alpha channel. However, when you convert to a wxImage, unless you use an undocumented function which only works on WindowsXP, you lose it. To output a wxBitmap to a file you have to convert to a wxImage.<p>
The workarounds for the incomplete alpha-channel support can be found in <a class="el" href="ImageManipulation_8cpp.html">ImageManipulation.cpp</a> . Also, in implementing <a class="el" href="Themability.html">Themability of Audacity</a> we keep both wxImages and wxBitmaps to work around the conversion problems.<p>
So, the wishlist item is for wxWidgets to sort this out!<h2><a class="anchor" name="WxWishlistTreebook">
wxTreeBook</a></h2>
We know a wxTreeBook is coming in wxWidgets 2.7.0. We're using a contrib-version that works pretty well, but using it as if it were a wxListBook. We've tried using wxWidgets 2.6.3 undocumented versions of wxChoiceBook and wxListBook, and in 2.6.3, neither is ready for prime time.<p>
We're looking forward to having a built in wxTreeBook.<h2><a class="anchor" name="WxWishlist">
Docking And Layout System</a></h2>
There are contrib directories that have partial implementations of Toolbar docking and layout. Our own system is rather hacked together, and just about meets our needs. We'd like a full strength system built in to wxWidgets. <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Sat Oct 11 21:08:36 2008 for Audacity by&nbsp;
