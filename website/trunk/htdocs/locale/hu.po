"<h3>Translation Instructions (software and web site)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Normally there will already be a translation for your language of the "
"Audacity software or web site, but often it needs to be updated for the "
"latest changes. <b>To update an existing translation</b>, use the links "
"below to download the .po file for your language:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><a href=\"%s\">Audacity translations</a></li>\n"
"  <li><a href=\"%s\">Audacity web site translations</a></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After clicking either link above, click on the link for the .po file for "
"your language. On the page you come to, scroll down to the blue \"File info"
"\" panel on the right, then right-click or control-click over the \"View raw "
"file\" link and \"save target\" or \"save link as\" to download the .po file."
"</p> \n"
"\n"
"<p><b>If there is no .po file for your language</b>, create one by "
"downloading the latest \"audacity.pot\" or \"audacity_website.pot\" file "
"under \"Resources for Translators\" above. (If the links only produce text "
"in the browser, right-click or control-click and save the target or link). "
"Rename the .pot to \"audacity.po\" (or \"audacity_website.po\" for web site "
"translation) before starting your translation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><b>Programs for creating and editing .po files:</b></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><a href=\"http://poedit.sourceforge.net/\">poEdit</a> for Windows and "
"Unix.</li>\n"
"  <li><a href=\"http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize\">Lokalize</a> for KDE4</"
"li>\n"
"  <li><a href=\"http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal/index"
"\">Virtaal</a></li>\n"
"  <li><a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/\">GNU gettext</a> is "
"standard on most Unix systems.  It includes a PO mode for the Emacs text "
"editor.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><b>Basic usage of poEdit:</b><p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>For a newly created .po file, set its properties by clicking "
"<b>Catalog > Settings</b> and filling in the required information. Set the "
"target language in the <b>Language</b> menu. Make sure to set the \"charset"
"\" option correctly, otherwise poEdit will not save any translations with "
"non-English characters. </li>\n"
"  <li>For an existing .po file, download \"audacity.pot\" or "
"\"audacity_website.pot\" from \"Resources for Translators\" above. In "
"poEdit, click <b>Catalog > Update from POT file</b> to update your .po file "
"with the latest strings from the downloaded .pot file. Then translate the ."
"po file (<b>not</b> the .pot file).</li>     \n"
"  <li>When you File > Save, poEdit saves the .po file, plus a .mo file for "
"use in Audacity.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><b>To test a translation in Audacity:</b></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Navigate to the \"Languages\" directory inside the Audacity "
"installation directory, and open the directory with the same name as your ."
"po file. If creating a new translation, create a directory in the \"Languages"
"\" folder using the correct language code from <a href=\"http://www.poedit."
"net/translations.php\">http://www.poedit.net/translations.php</a>. For "
"example, the code for Tamil is \"ta\", so create \"Audacity\\Languages\\ta\"."
"</li>\n"
"  <li>Rename the saved <b>.mo</b> file to \"Audacity.mo\", and paste it into "
"the directory you opened or created.</li>\n"
"  <li>Open Audacity and in <b>Preferences: Interface</b>, choose your "
"language and click OK. You should now see your translations. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><b>Further information:</b></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><b>To submit a translation</b>, please send the completed .po file to "
"the audacity-translation mailing list. A member of Audacity Team will commit "
