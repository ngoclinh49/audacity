<h1>選單列</h1>






<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_track">音軌跳出選單</a></h2>






<img src="images/track-popdown.png" height="184" width="547">
<br>






<p>當您按下音軌的標題名稱，就會跳出「音軌跳出選單」。「音軌跳出選單」讓您對個別的音軌下一些特殊的命令。<br>






</p>






<p><b>命名...</b> - 讓您變更音軌的名稱。<br>






</p>






<p><b>向上移動音軌</b> - 與上面的音軌交換位置。<br>






</p>






<p><b>向下移動音軌</b> - 與下面的音軌交換位置。<br>






</p>






<p><b>波形</b> - 顯示聲音波形 ─ 當您打開一個聲音檔案，這是您預設會看到的波形。
<br>






</p>






<p><b>波形 (dB)</b> - 與上一個類似，不過您看到的振幅是取對數過後的(logarithmic scale)，單位是分貝(dB)。<br>






</p>






<p><b>頻譜</b> - 顯示頻譜，顯示不同頻率帶有的能量。<br>






</p>






<p><b>音高 (EAC)</b> - 利用Enhanced
Autocorrelation (EAC) 演算法，強調出聲音的基頻(音樂音高)曲線。<br>






</p>






<p><b>單聲道</b> - 這個音軌只有一個揚聲器播出，或者是左揚聲器與右揚聲器所播放的是一樣的聲音。<br>






</p>






<p><b>左聲道</b> - 這個音軌只會在左揚聲器播出。<br>






</p>






<p><b>右聲道</b> - 這個音軌只會在右揚聲器播出。
</p>






<p><b>製作立體聲音軌</b> -
如果在此音軌下有其他的音軌，將它們加入到此音軌，變成單一立體聲音軌，上面的音軌代表左聲道，下面的音軌代表右聲道。當兩個獨立的音軌合併成音體聲音軌
後，所有的編輯效果會同時套用到左右兩個音軌。<br>






</p>






<p><b>分離立體聲音軌</b> -
如果已選取的音軌是一個立體聲音軌，這個操作可以使他們分離成兩個音軌，如此一來您就能獨立的修改及編輯這兩個音軌。<br>






</p>






<p><b>設定取樣格式</b> - 這個選單決定此音訊資料的品質。 音訊CD使用的品質是 16-bit
，這也是Audacity內最小品質。 (8-bit audio files are
automatically converted to at least 16-bit when you open them).
更高級的音訊使用24-bit。32-bit <i>float</i>
是Audacity支援的最高品質。我們建議您使用此設定，除非您的電腦配備不支援以及您的磁碟空間不足。<br>






</p>






<p><b>設定取樣頻率</b> - 設定一個音軌每秒鐘的取樣數目。音訊CD使用44100
Hz。不同的音軌可以使用不同的取樣頻率；他們會自動重新取樣以符合成音工程速率。(in the lower-left corner of the
window).
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_file">檔案選單</a></h2>






<b>開新檔案</b> - 建立一個空白檔案。
<br>






<p><b>開啟舊檔...</b> - 在新視窗開啟一個已存在的音訊檔案或者Audacity工程檔案(unless the current
window is empty)。若要將音訊檔案加入目前視窗的工程，請使用<a href="reference.html#menu_project">工程</a>選單中的任何「匯入」指令。<br>






</p>






<p><b>關閉</b> - 關閉目前的視窗，並詢問是否要儲存變更的部分。在 Windows 及 Unix
上，關閉最後一個視窗會結束&nbsp;，除非您修改<a href="reference.html#prefs">偏好設定</a>裡「介面」中的
「在關閉最後一個視窗後結束 Audacity」。<br>






</p>






<p><b>儲存成音工程</b> - 將視窗中所有的東西儲存成Audacity專有格式，這樣您就可以保存您目前的作業，稍後再做。一個成音工程包含一個成音工程檔案，其附檔名為 <tt>".aup"；一個工程資料夾，其</tt>資料夾名稱結尾為<tt>"_data"。舉例來說，如果您的工程名稱為</tt>"Composition"，那麼Audacity會建立一個<tt>名為"Composition.aup"的檔案以及</tt>一個名為<tt>"</tt><tt>Composition_data</tt>"的資料夾。Audacity工程檔案並不是用來與其他程式分享使用的，當您完成一個工程後，使用匯出命令來匯出其他程式能使用的檔案。<br>






</p>






<p><b>另存成音工程...</b> - 與「儲存成音工程」(上一個選單)相同，不過它讓您將工程另存成一個新的名字。<br>






</p>






<p><b>匯出為 WAV...</b> - 將成音工程裡所有音軌匯出為
WAV 檔案，這是未壓縮聲音檔案的工業標準。You can
change the standard file format used for exporting from Audacity by
opening the File Format <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>.
Note that exporting will automatically mix and resample if you have
more than one track, or varying sample rates. See also
<a href="#fileformats">File Formats</a>.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>將選取範圍匯出為 WAV...</b> - 與上一個相同，不過只匯出目前選取範圍。
</p>






<p><b>匯出為 MP3...</b> - 將音訊匯出成MP3檔案。MP3檔案是一種壓縮過的檔案格式，因此可以大量減少所佔據的磁碟空間，不過也損失了音質。 Another compressed alternative
is Ogg Vorbis (below). You can set the quality of MP3 compression
in the File Format <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>. See also
<a href="#exportmp3">MP3 Exporting</a>.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>將選取範圍匯出為 MP3...</b> - 與上一個相同，不過只匯出目前選取範圍。
</p>






<p><b>匯出為 Vorbis...</b> - 將聲音匯出為 Ogg Vorbis
檔案。Ogg Vorbis 檔案是壓縮過的，因此可以節省磁碟的空間，但是會有音質上的損失。Ogg Vorbis 檔案的目的就像 MP3
一樣，壓縮聲音來減少檔案體積，而且 Ogg Vorbis 沒有專利的問題。不過，Ogg Vorbis 檔案不像 MP3 一樣廣泛地使用。您可以在<a href="reference.html#prefs">「偏好設定</a>」裡的「檔案格式」設定 Ogg 壓縮品質。<br>






</p>






<p><b>將選取範圍匯出為 Ogg Vorbis...</b> - 與上一個相同，不過只匯出目前選取範圍。<br>






</p>






<p><b>匯出標籤...</b> - 如果您的成音工程裡有<a href="#track_label">標籤軌</a>，這個命令讓您可以將標籤
軌匯出成文字檔案。您可以在<a href="reference.html#menu_project">工程選單</a>裡用「匯入標籤」這個命令匯
入符合標籤文字格式的檔案。<br>






</p>






<p><b>偏好設定...</b> - 開啟<a href="#prefs">偏好設定</a>對話框。<br>






</p>






<p><b>結束</b> - 關閉所有的視窗，如果有修改的部分尚未儲存，會跳出對話框詢問您是否要儲存。<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_edit">編輯選單</a></h2>






<b>復原</b> - 這個動作會取消上一次編輯的動作。Audacity 支援無限次的復原，這代表著您可以完全復原至檔案原來的狀態。<br>






<p><b>重做</b> - This will redo any editing operations that were just
undone.
After you perform a new editing operation,
you can no longer redo the operations that were undone.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>剪下</b> - Removes the selected audio data and places it on the
clipboard.
Only one "thing" can be on the clipboard at a time, but it may
contain multiple tracks.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>複製</b> - 將選取的聲音複製一份至剪貼簿。<br>






</p>






<p><b>貼上</b> - Inserts whatever is on the clipboard at the position of
the
selection or cursor in the project, replacing whatever audio data
is currently selected, if any.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>Trim</b> - 保留選取的範圍而將其他部分移除。<br>






</p>






<p><b>刪除</b> - 將選取的聲音刪除，而不是複製一份至剪貼簿。<br>






</p>






<p><b>靜音</b> - 將選取的聲音範圍變為靜音。<br>






</p>






<p><b>分離</b> - Moves the selected region into its own track or tracks,
replacing the affected portion of the original track with silence.
See the figure below:
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<center><img src="images/split.png" alt="Split function illustration" border="0" height="88" width="320"></center>






<br>






<p><b>複製到新音軌</b> - Makes a copy of all or part of a track or set of
tracks
into new tracks. See the figure below:
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<center><img src="images/duplicate.png" alt="Duplicate function illustration" border="0" height="88" width="320"></center>






<br>






<p><b>全選</b> - 選取全部的音軌範圍。<br>






</p>






<p><b>選取從起始點至游標位置</b> -選取從音軌的起始點開始到游標現在的位置。<br>






</p>






<p><b>選取從游標位置至結束點</b> - 選取從游標現在的位置開始到音軌的結束點。<br>






</p>






<p><b>尋找零交點[Zero Crossing]</b> - Modifies the selection slightly so
that both
the left and right edge of the selection appear on a positive-slope
zero crossing. This makes it easier to cut and paste audio without
resulting
in a large audible clicking sound.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>儲存選取</b> - Remembers the current selection (or cursor position),
allowing you to restore it later.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>恢復選取</b> - Restores the cursor position to the last position
saved by "Selection Save".
<br>






</p>






<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">移動游標至音軌起始點</span><br>






</p>






<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">移動游標至音軌結束點</span>
</p>






<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">移動游標至選取起始點</span>
</p>






<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">移動游標至選取結束點</span>
</p>






<p><b>開啟吸附功能</b> - When Snap-To mode is enabled, the selection will be
constrained to the nearest interval, by default the nearest second.
So if you click and drag from 4.2 seconds to 9.8 seconds, it will
result
in a selection from 4 seconds to 10 seconds, exactly. You can change
the
units that are snapped to using the "Set Selection Format" option in
the&nbsp;<a href="#menu_view">檢視選單</a>。<br>






</p>






<p><b>關閉吸附功能</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;將吸附功能關閉，讓您可以選取任意的時間點。<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_view">檢視選單</a></h2>






<b>放大</b> - Zooms in on the horizontal axis of the audio,
displaying more detail about less time. You can also use the zoom
tool to zoom in on a particular part of the window.
<br>






<p><b>一般</b> - 以每秒一英吋來顯示。Zooms to the default view, which displays about
one inch per second.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>縮小</b> - 拉遠來看，顯示較少細節、更多的時間範圍。Zooms out, displaying less detail
about more time.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>成音工程適合視窗大小</b> - Zooms out until the entire project just
fits in the window.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>適合垂直大小</b> - Resizes all of the tracks vertically so they
all fit inside of the window (if possible).
<br>






</p>






<p><b>縮放選取範圍符合視窗</b> - 將選取的範圍放大或縮小，使得選取的範圍填滿視窗。Zooms in or out so that the selection
fills
the window.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>設定選取範圍格式</b> - lets you choose the formatting that is
displayed at the bottom of the window indicating the current selection
time. Options include film, video, and audio CD frames, seconds +
samples,
or pure time. If you turn on Snap-To mode in the
<a href="#menu_edit">Edit Menu</a>, the selection will snap to the
frames or other quantization you have selected in this menu.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>工作歷史...</b> - Brings up the history window.
It shows all the actions you have performed during the current session,
including importing. The right-hand column shows the amount of hard
disk
space your operations used. You can jump back and forth between editing
steps quite easily by simply clicking on the entries in the window, the
same as selecting Undo or Redo many times in a row. You can also
discard
Undo history to save disk space.
The history window can be kept open while you work.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>描繪頻譜</b> -
To use this feature, first select a region of audio from a single
track, then select "Plot Spectrum".
It opens up a window that
displays the Power Spectrum of the audio over that region, calculated
using the Fast Fourier Transform. The graph represents how much
energy is in each frequency. As you move the mouse over the display,
it shows you the nearest peak frequency.
This window can also display other common
functions that are calculated using the Fast Fourier Transform,
including
three versions of the Autocorrelation function.
The Enhanced Autocorrelation function is very good at identifying the
pitch of a note.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>浮動控制工具列</b> - moves the <a href="#toolbar_control">控制工具列</a> out
of the window and
into its own
floating window, so you can position it wherever you want. The menu
item changes to&nbsp;<b>停駐</b><b>控制工具列</b>, which you can use to
put the toolbar back into the main window.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>浮動編輯工具列</b> - moves the <a href="#toolbar_edit">編輯工具列</a> out of
the window and into its
own
floating window, so you can position it wherever you want. The menu
item changes to&nbsp;<b>停駐</b><b>編輯工具列</b>, which you can use to

<p></p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_project">工程選單</a></h2>






<b>匯入聲音檔案...</b> - This command is used to import audio from a standard
audio format into
your project. Use this command if you already have a couple of tracks
and you want to add another track to the same project, maybe to mix
them together.
You cannot use this option to import Audacity Projects. The only way
to combine two Audacity Projects is to open them in separate windows,
then copy and paste the tracks.
<br>






<p><b>匯入標籤...</b> - This command takes a text file which contains time
codes and labels,
and turns them into a <a href="#track_label">標籤軌</a>.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>匯入 MIDI...</b> - This menu command imports MIDI files and puts
them into a <a href="#track_midi">MIDI 音軌</a>. Audacity can display
MIDI files, but cannot play, edit, or save them yet.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>匯入原始數據[Raw Data]...</b> - This menu command allows you to open a
file in virtually any
format, as long as it is not compressed. When you select the file,
Audacity will analyze it and try to guess its format.
It will guess correctly about 90% of the time, so you can try just
pressing "OK" and listening to the result. If it is not correct,
however,
you can use the options in the dialog to try some other possible
encodings.
</p>






<p>At the beginning of your imported track(s), you may notice a little
bit of noise. This is probably the file's header, which Audacity
was not able to parse. Just zoom in and select the noise with the
<a href="#toolbar_control">Selection Tool</a>, and then
choose Delete from the <a href="#menu_edit">編輯選單</a>.

</p>






<p><b>編輯 ID3 Tags...</b> - 開啟一個對話視窗，讓您編輯此工程的ID3標籤，讓您在匯出MP3時使用。<br>






</p>






<p><b>快速混音</b> - This command mixes all of the selected tracks
together. If you are
mixing stereo tracks, or mixing tracks that are marked as Left or
Right channel, the result will be a stereo track (two channels),
otherwise
the result will be mono.
</p>






<p>Your tracks are implicitly mixed whenever you hit the Play
button and whenever you export.
</p>






<p>Note that if you try to mix two very loud tracks together, you may
get clipping (it will sound like pops, clicks, and noise).
To avoid this, drag the gain slider on the tracks down to reduce their
volume before mixing.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>新增音軌</b> -
建立一個新音軌。這個命令不常用，因為匯入、錄音、混音等動作就會自動新增一個新音軌了。不過您還是可以建立一個新音軌，從現存的音軌複製或剪下一段聲音
然後貼到新音軌上。<br>






</p>






<p><b>新增立體聲音軌</b> - 與上一個相同，不過建立的是立體聲音軌。您也可以利用跳出選單將兩個音軌合成一個立體聲音軌。<br>






</p>






<p><b>新增標籤軌</b> - 建立一個新<a href="#track_label">標籤軌</a>，讓您能在標籤軌上作記號。<br>






</p>






<p><b>新增時間軌</b> - This creates a new <a href="#track_time">Time Track</a>,
which is used to vary the speed of playback over time.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>移除音軌</b> - This command removes the selected track or tracks from
the project.
Even if only part of a track is selected, the entire track is removed.
You can also delete a track by clicking the X in its upper-left corner.
To cut out only part of the audio in a track, use
<a href="#menu_file">Delete</a> or <a href="#menu_file">Silence</a>.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>對齊音軌...</b> - All the Align functions work on whole tracks or
groups of tracks,
not on selections, even if they span across multiple tracks.
They all operate by time-shifting tracks (moving them left or
right), making it easier to synchronize tracks or get rid of silence
at the beginning. The cursor or selection stays in the same place
unless you use "Align and move cursor...", below:
<br>






</p>






<p><b>對齊並移動游標...</b> - same as the functions above, except
that the cursor or selection is moved along with the tracks. That
allows you to shift the tracks without losing your relative place.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>在選取範圍加上標籤</b> - This menu item lets you create a new label at the
current selection.
You can title the label by typing with the keyboard and then hitting
"Enter"
when you're done.
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_generate">產生選單</a></h2>






當游標沒有在音軌裡，或者您沒有選取任何音軌或範圍，執行產生選單裡的功能時，會產生一個新的音軌，內含三十秒您所要產生的聲音。<br>






<p>如果您選擇了一個音軌，游標在音軌上的某一點，那麼會在游標位置後插入三十秒您所要產生的聲音。<br>






</p>






<p>如果您選擇了音軌裡的一段範圍，那麼會從選取範圍的起始點開始插入您所要產生的聲音，長度與您所選取範圍的長度一樣。而您原本所選取的聲音被擠到選
取範圍的右側。<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr width="50%"><br>






<p><b>靜音</b> - 在音軌中插入一段靜音。<br>






</p>






<p><b>基音[Tone]...</b> - 您可以產生弦波、方波、或鋸齒波。<br>






</p>






<p><b>白雜音[White Noise]</b> - 插入隨機的聲音取樣，聽起來就像靜電干擾。<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr width="50%"><br>






<p>Any items which appear after these three built-ins are VST,
Ladspa, or Nyquist plug-ins. It is possible for a poorly written
plug-in to crash Audacity, so always save your work before using a
plug-in. Note that any effect that doesn't take any audio as input
will automatically be placed in the Generate menu.
</p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_effect">效果選單</a></h2>






The items in this menu only work when you have audio selected.
Audacity does not have any real-time effects; you must select the
audio, apply the effect, and then listen to the results.
<br>






<p>Most effects have a Preview button. Clicking on this button plays
up to three seconds of audio, allowing you to hear what it will sound
like after the effect is applied. This is useful for fine-tuning the
effect parameters.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>重複最近一次效果</b> - selecting this command is a shortcut to
applying the most recent effect with the same settings. This is a
convenient way to quickly apply the same effect to many different parts
of
a file.
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr width="50%"><br>






<p><b>增幅[Amplify]</b> - changes the volume of the selected audio. If
you
click the "Don't allow clipping" checkbox, it won't let you amplify
so much that the audio ends up beyond the range of the waveform.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>低音增強[BassBoost]</b> - 增強低頻的部分。<br>






</p>






<p><b>變更音高[Change Pitch]</b> - changes the pitch/frequency of the
selected audio
without changing the tempo. When you open the dialog, the starting
frequency is set to Audacity's best guess as to the frequency of the
selection. This works well for recordings of singing or musical
instruments without background noise. You can specify the pitch change
in one of four different ways: musical note, semitones, frequency, or
percent change.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>變更速度[Change Speed]</b> - changes the speed of the audio by
resampling.
Making the speed higher will also increase the pitch, and vice versa.
This will change the length of the selection.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>變更節拍[Change Tempo]</b> - changes the tempo (speed) of the audio
without
changing the pitch. This will change the length of the selection.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>壓縮[Compressor]</b> - compresses the dynamic range of the
selection so
that the loud parts are softer while keeping the volume of the soft
parts the same. You can optionally apply gain, resulting
in the entire piece having higher perceived volume.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>迴音[Echo]</b> - very simple effect that repeats the selection with
a
decay, sounding like a series of echos. This effect does not change
the length of the selection, so you may want to add silence to the end
of the track before applying it (using the
<a href="#menu_generate">Generate Menu</a>).
<br>






</p>






<p><b>等化[Equalization]</b> - Boost or reduce arbitrary frequencies. You
can
select one of a number of different curves designed to equalize the
sound of some popular record players, or draw your own curve.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>淡入[Fade In]</b> - 將選取範圍線性地淡入。<br>






</p>






<p><b>淡出[Fade Out]</b> - 將選取範圍線性地淡出。
</p>






<p><b>FFT濾波器</b> - similar to Equalization, lets you enhance or reduce
arbitrary frequencies. The curve here uses a linear scale for
frequency.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>波形上下反轉[Invert]</b> - 波形上下反轉，也就是反相。<br>






</p>






<p><b>去雜音[Noise Removal]</b> - This effect lets you clean up noise from
a recording.
First, select a small piece of audio that is silent except for the
noise,
select "Noise Removal", and click on the "Get Noise Profile" button.
Then select all of the audio you want filtered select "Noise Removal"
again, and click the "Remove Noise" button. You can experiment with
the slider to try to remove more or less noise. It is normal for
Noise Removal to result in some distortion. It works best when the
audio signal is much louder than the noise.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>標準化[Normalize]</b> - allows you to correct for DC offset (a
vertical
displacement of the track) and/or amplify such that the maximum
amplitude is a fixed amount, -3 dB. It's useful to normalize all
of your tracks before mixing.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>Nyquist 表示式</b> - for advanced users only. Allows you to
express arbitrary transormations using a powerful functional
programming language. See the Nyquist section of the Audacity
website for more information.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>移相器[Phaser]</b> - the name "Phaser" comes from "Phase Shifter",
because it
works by combining phase-shifted signals with the original
signal. The movement of the phase-shifted signals is
controlled using a Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO).
<br>






</p>






<p><b>重複[Repeat]</b> - repeats the selection a certain number of times.
This operation is quite fast and space-efficient, so it is practical
to use it to create nearly-infinite loops.
<br>






</p>






<p><b>時間前後反轉[Reverse]</b> -&nbsp;時間前後反轉之後，原本在後面的聲音會先播放，在前面的聲音後播放。<br>






</p>






<p><b>Wahwah</b> - uses a moving bandpass filter to create its
sound. A low frequency oscillator (LFO) is used to
control the movement of the filter throughout the
frequency spectrum. Adjusts the phase of the left and right
channels when given a stereo selection, so that the effect seems
to travel across the speakers.
<br>






</p>

<p>Any items which appear after these built-in effects are VST,
Ladspa, or Nyquist plug-ins. It is possible for a poorly written
plug-in to crash Audacity, so always save your work before using a

<hr>
<h2><a name="menu_analyze">分析選單</a></h2>






The Analyze menu is intended for effects and plug-in effects that
do not modify the audio, but simply open a dialog with some
descriptive information. Audacity also supports Analyze commands that
create annotations in a <a href="#track_label">Label Track</a>.
<br>






<p>Audacity does not come with any built-in Analyze commands, so

<hr width="50%"><br>






<p></p>






<h3>波形顯示</h3>






<br>






<p><img src="images/track-waveform.png" height="179" width="414">
<br>






</p>






<p>這裡顯示出音軌的波形，或者可以更改設定而顯示出頻譜。This is the waveform display part of the track, although it is also
possible to display a spectrogram instead of a waveform here.
</p>






<p>This image shows a stereo track, which is a group of two tracks -
the
top one is for the left channel, and the bottom one is for the right
channel. If you need to edit the two channels as separate tracks,
you can split them using the <a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a>.
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr width="50%"><br>






<p></p>






<h3>標籤</h3>






<br>






<p><img src="images/track-label.png" height="179" width="97">
<br>






</p>






<p>The label appears directly to the left of every track. Clicking
in the label outside of one of its buttons or controls selects the
entire track. Shift-clicking a track label adds or removes that
track from the selection. Also, clicking and dragging a track label
is one way to rearrange the order of tracks.
</p>






<p>At the top-right of the label is the close box. Click here to
delete the track (though you can Undo this operation).
</p>






<p>To the right of the close box is the track's title. Clicking on the
title brings up the <a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a>,
allowing you to rearrange tracks and change various track options:
</p>






<p>The next line in the label tells you the channel of the track
(left, right, mono, or stereo) and the sample rate (e.g. 44100 Hz is
the audio CD rate). Beneath that is the quality - 32-bit float is
high quality but takes up more disk space, and 16-bit is the same
quality as an audio CD.
</p>






<p>The Mute button stops this track from playing. The Solo button
plays only this track (or other solo tracks) and overrides the
Mute button. Muting and soloing doesn't affect mixing or exporting,
just playback within Audacity.
</p>






<p>The top slider is the gain control - it affects the relative volume
of the track. By default it only lets you select multiples of 3 dB,
but if you hold down shift you can choose any level. Be careful not
to set it too high, or you can exceed the maximum volume of a track,
which results in clipping.
</p>






<p>The bottom slider is the pan control - it affects the balance
between
the left and right speakers.
</p>






<hr width="50%"><br>






<p></p>






<h3>垂直尺規</h3>






<br>






<p><img src="images/track-vruler.png" height="179" width="37">
<br>






</p>






<p>垂直尺規顯示波形振幅的基準。一個聲音檔案最大幅度設成從 1.0 至 -1.0&nbsp; - 超過這個振幅的部分會被截掉，聽起來會失真。
</p>






<p>當游標移至尺規上，會變成放大鏡。左鍵點擊會垂直放，右鍵點擊或者Shift - 左鍵點擊會垂直縮小。 縮小最遠可至振幅
2，方便您編輯波封。
</p>






<p>When zooming vertically, Audacity will automatically "snap" to the
normal range of -1...1 when you get close. 如果您無法重設垂直尺規，先縮小至最小，也就是振幅是-2
~ +2，然後再點擊左鍵放大一次就可以回到-1 ~+1。
</p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="track_label">標籤軌</a></h2>






<img src="images/labeltrack_1.png" height="25" width="584">
<br>






<p>Label Tracks can be used to annotate an audio file. They can be used
for lyrics, markers, or notes, and they can even be used to save
selections.
<br>






</p>






<p>To create a Label Track, select New Label Track from the
<a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>. Alternatively, simply
click or select where you would like to place a label, and choose
Add Label at Selection from the <a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>,
and a Label Track will be created automatically if one doesn't already
exist.
<br>






</p>






<p>To add a new label, click or select where you want the new label to
appear,
then select Add Label at Selection from the
<a href="#menu_project">工程選單</a>, then type the name of the
label, and finally press Enter or click outside of the label.
<br>






</p>






<p>To edit the name of a label, click anywhere in it.
Zoom in first if there are too many labels crowded together and you
are unable to click on the one you want. When a label is selected
for editing, it looks like the first label below:
<br>






</p>






<p><img src="images/labeltrack_2.png" height="25" width="584">
<br>






</p>






<p>When editing the name of a label, you are limited to using just
the backspace key for editing. There is no way to move the
insertion point to append a letter to the beginning of a label.
<br>






</p>






<p>Once a label is selected, you can move to the next label by pressing
Tab, and move to the previous label by pressing Shift-Tab.
<br>






</p>






<p>To delete a label or multiple labels, select the area containing the
label flags you wish to delete, and choose Silence from the
<a href="#menu_edit">編輯選單</a>. Alternatively you can delete
an individual label by clicking on it and pressing Backspace until you
have deleted all of the characters in the label, then pressing Enter.
<br>






</p>






<p>To move labels, use the normal editing commands like Cut, Copy,
Paste, Delete, and Silence.
<br>






</p>






<p>You can save a selection in a label. When you create a new
label, the left selection edge determines the position of the label's
flag. However, the right selection edge is also stored in the label,
and when you click on it, the full original selection will be restored.
If you wish to apply this selection to only a subset of the tracks,
shift-click in the label area to the left of each track's waveform
to change whether each track is part of the selection or not.
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<h3>匯入及匯出標籤軌</h3>






Label Tracks are saved when you save an Audacity Project, so if you
just want to continue using the labels along with the same file,
just save a project. But you can also export the labels to a simple
text file, and import them. This allows you to save information about
the locations of events in an audio file for use in another program,
and also provides a way to mass-edit the labels if necessary.
<br>






<p>To export a Label Track, choose Export Labels... from the&nbsp;<a href="#menu_file">檔案選單</a>. The exported file will
contain one line per label, starting with the time offset in
seconds, then a tab, and then the name of the label, for example:
<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<pre>1.217995    Bass intro<br>3.921073    Guitar enters<br>7.584454    Drums enter<br>11.070002   Chorus<br></pre>






<br>






<p>請選擇<a href="#menu_file">檔案選單</a>裡的「匯入標籤&hellip;」來匯入標籤軌。<br>






</p>






<p></p>






<hr>
<h2><a name="track_time">時間軌</a></h2>






The Time Track is an experimental new feature that lets you change
the rate of playback over time. Start by choosing
New Time Track from the <a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>.
Then change the range of time warping by clicking on the
<a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a> and choosing
Set Range (an option which only appears for Time Tracks).
You can also optionally choose the converter from a choice of
5 algorithms, from fast and low quality to slow and high quality.
Older computers may be incapable of playing audio in real-time
that makes use of a Time Track, however you can always Export the
file as a WAV and then playback the WAV file later.
<br>






<p>To edit the time warping, choose the envelope tool from the
<a href="#toolbar_control">控制工具列</a> - the same tool
you use to edit amplitude envelopes in Audio Tracks. Click to
create and edit control points. Drag points off-screen to
delete them.
<br>






</p>






<p>The Time Track has a ruler. As you edit the warping, the ruler will
warp to show you at what time playback will reach each place in the
audio.

<h2><a name="track_midi">MIDI 音軌</a> (不完全的)</h2>






Audacity 目前支援顯示 MIDI 檔案，您必須使用在工程選單裡的「匯入 MIDI 」。<br>






<p>Audacity 不支援播放、錄製、編輯 MIDI 檔案，甚至不支援儲存 MIDI 音軌。這些功能已列入未來 Audaicty
版本的計畫中，不過至少在 2004 年以前都不會支援。<br>






</p>






<p>The current functionality is useful to only a small group of people
who
are studying algorithms that relate MIDI data to audio data and simply
wish to see the visual representation of the MIDI data and how it lines
up with the audio data.

<h3>音訊 I/O</h3>






<ul>






  <li><b>播放裝置</b> - Use this control to select the device that will be
used for playback / audio output. This is usually only applicable if
your computer has more than one sound card.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>錄音裝置</b> - Select the devce that will be used for recording /
audio input. Note that many devices have multiple <i>sources</i> such
as Microphone and Line in - to select the input source you will need to
use the <a href="#toolbar_mixer">Mixer Toolbar</a>.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p> For finer control over audio I/O, open your system's Sound
control panel or the control panel that came with your sound card. </p>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>Recording Channels</b> - Use this to select the number of
channels to record simultaneously. Select 1 for mono and 2 for stereo.
Audacity will support recording more simultaneous channels, but note
that most sound cards only support stereo, and even if your sound card
supports more than 2 inputs, you need a fast computer and a large, fast
hard disk to record many channels for a long time.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p> Mono recording is not the same on all computers or sound cards.
Sometimes recording mono only records the left channel, and sometimes
it mixes the left and right channels. </p>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>在錄製新音軌時播放其他的音軌</b> - When this box is checked, Audacity will
play existing tracks when you press record - otherwise it simply
records the new track without letting you hear what you've already
recorded. You can use this option to record harmonies with yourself or
add a voiceover.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p> You may notice that when you play the two tracks you recorded
together, they aren't synchronized. This is unavoidable to a certain
extent, though future versions of Audacity may try to minimize it even
more. To fix it, you will need to grab the <a href="#toolbar_control">Time
Shift</a> tool and slide one of the tracks around until it sounds
right. </p>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p> Note that this is not the same as <b>playthrough</b>, which
means having the computer play the track that you are currently
recording, as you are recording it. You may be able to enable this
using your operating system's Mixer or Sound control panel, but
Audacity does not have an option to turn on Playthrough directly. </p>

<h3>品質</h3>






<ul>






  <li><b>預設取樣頻率</b> - 這個選項控制新成音工程的取樣頻率。若要更改現有工程的取樣頻率，用程式主視窗左下角的控制項來更改。
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>預設取樣格式</b> - This controls the default format used to store
audio samples. 16-bit takes up the least space and is equivalent to
audio CD quality. 32-bit float takes up twice as much space but is much
more flexible.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p> If you have a fast computer and enough disk space, you should
always use 32-bit float samples while editing, and then export your
final mix as a 16-bit WAV file (the default). </p>

      <li><b>在編輯前製作檔案備份 (較安全)</b> - Selecting this means that Audacity
will take longer to import files, but it will always have its own copy
of any audio you are using in a project. You can move, change, or throw
away your files immediately after you open or import them into
Audacity.

      <li><b>從原始檔案中直接讀取(快速)</b>&nbsp;- Selecting this means that
Audacity depends on your original audio files being there, and only
stores changes you make to these files. If you move, change, or throw
away one of the files you imported into Audacity, your project may
become unusable. However, because Audacity doesn't need to make copies
of everything first, it can import files in much less time.

  <li><b>Ogg 匯出設定</b> - Use this control to set the quality of Ogg
Vorbis exporting. Ogg Vorbis is a compressed audio format similar to
MP3, but free of patents and licensing fees. A normal quality Ogg
Vorbis file is encoded with a quality setting of "5". Note that unlike
MP3 encoding, Ogg Vorbis does not let you set a bitrate, because some
audio clips are easier to compress than others. Increasing the quality
will always increase the file size, however.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>MP3&nbsp;</b><b>匯出設定</b> - Use these controls to locate your
MP3 encoder and set the quality of MP3 encoding. Higher quality files
take up more space, so you will need to find the level of quality you
feel is the best compromise. For more information, see <a href="#exportmp3">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






</ul>






<h3>聲譜圖</h3>






You can view any audio track as a Spectrogram instead of a
Waveform by selecting one of the Spectral views from the
<a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a>.
This dialog lets you adjust some of the settings for these
spectrograms.
<p></p>






<ul>






  <li><b>FFT 的取樣點數</b> - The size of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
affects how much vertical (frequency) detail you see. Larger FFT sizes
give you more bass resolution and less temporal resolution, and they
are slower. </li>






  <li><b>灰階</b> - Select this for gray spectrograms instead of colored
ones. </li>






  <li><b>最高頻率</b> - Set this value anywhere from a couple of hundred
hertz to half the sample rate (i.e. 22050 Hz if the sample rate is
44100 Hz). For some applications, such as speech recognition or pitch
extraction, very high frequencies are not important (visually), so this
allows you to hide these and only focus on the ones you care about. </li>






</ul>






<h3>資料夾路徑</h3>






Use this panel to set the location of Audacity's temporary directory
(folder). Audacity uses this directory whenever you work on a project
that you haven't saved as an Audacity Project (AUP file) yet. You have
to restart Audacity (close and open it again) for changes to the
temporary directory to take effect.
<p></p>






<h3>介面</h3>






<ul>






  <li><b>在播放中自動捲動</b> - Scrolls the window for you while playing, so
that the playback cursor is always in the window. This can hurt
playback performance on slower computers.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>總是允許暫停</b> - Normally the Pause button is only enabled while
you are playing or recording. Checking this box allows you to set the
pause button anytime, which allows you to press Record and not have the
recording start until you unpause it. Sometimes starting a paused
recording can be faster than starting to record in the first place.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>在播放時更新頻譜圖</b> - Because spectrograms are slower to draw,
normally they are not drawn during playback, but this option lets you
draw the spectrograms anyway.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>啟用編輯工具列</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display the <a href="#toolbar_edit">Edit Toolbar</a>, which has some common shortcuts
for editing commands. </li>






  <li><b>啟用混音工具列</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display the <a href="#toolbar_mixer">Mixer Toolbar</a>, which lets you set the volume
levels and input source. </li>






  <li><b>在關閉最後一個視窗後結束 Audacity</b> - By default on Windows and
X-Windows (but not Mac OS), Audacity quits when you close the last
project window. If you uncheck this box, Audacity will open a new blank
document instead of quitting. To quit Audacity in this case, you must
specifically select Exit (or Quit) from the File menu.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>允許拖動選取範圍左右兩端</b> - Normally, when you move the mouse over the
left and right edge of a selection, the cursor changes to a left or
right pointer, and you can adjust that edge of the selection
independently. If you don't like this feature, uncheck this box, and
then clicking will always create a new selection (unless you hold down
Shift to extend an existing selection).
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><b>語言</b> - 設定 Audacity 介面使用的語言。語言檔案的名字為 "audacity.mo" ，在
Windows 及 Mac OS X 上是放在 "Languages" 資料夾裡，在大部分的 Unix 系統裡則是
/usr/share/locale 或
/usr/local/share/locale 。在每一次啟動 Audacity 時，皆會自動偵測是否有新的語言檔案。
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






</ul>






<h3>鍵盤功能設定</h3>






這個功能表讓您設定鍵盤快速鍵。All of the commands
that appear in Audacity menus appear on the left, along with a few
other buttons that can get keyboard shortcuts. To change a command,
first click on the command you want to change. Then type the new
keyboard shortcut on your keyboard. Verify that the correct shortcut
appears in the box below. If it's what you want, press the <b>Set</b>
button. Or to get rid of a keyboard shortcut, press <b>Clear</b>.
<p>To reset to Audacity's defaults, press the <b>Defaults</b> button.
This will get rid of any changes you have made.
</p>






<p>If you have customized your keyboard layout and want to share it
with someone else, you can press <b>Save...</b> and save your complete
keyboard layout as an XML file that you can share. To load an existing
layout, press the <b>Load...</b> button and locate the XML file.
</p>






<p></p>






<h3>滑鼠功能表</h3>






這個功能表不能變更，僅僅是讓您瀏覽所用讓滑鼠操作的命令。

<h2><a name="fileformats">聲音檔案格式</a></h2>






<h3>Audacity Project format (AUP)</h3>






Audacity 成音工程的檔案副檔名為 AUP，這種格式是&nbsp;Audacity
最佳化的格式，讓工程檔案開啟及儲存皆非常快速。為了達到高速存取 ， Audacity
將大檔案切割成許多部分，將這些小部分存在一個資料夾裡，命名為工程檔案對映的檔名。例如：如果您的工程命名為 "chanson" ，那麼
Audacity 會建立一個名為 <tt>chanson.aup 的檔案來儲存工程資訊，並且建立一個名為</tt> <tt>chanson_data</tt>
的資料夾，將聲音片段存這此處。While the Audacity Project format is based on XML and is
meant to be
open, it is not currently compatible with any other audio
programs, so when you are finished working on a project and you
want to be able to edit the audio in another program, select
Export from the <a href="#menu_file">File Menu</a>.
<p></p>






<h3>WAV (Windows Wave format)</h3>






這是 Windows 預設未壓縮的聲音檔案格式，而且幾乎所有的電腦系統都支援這種格式。Audacity 可以讀寫這種格式。
<p></p>






<h3>AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)</h3>






這是&nbsp;Macintosh 預設未壓縮的聲音檔案格式，而且幾乎所有的電腦系統都支援這種格式，但不如WAV格式如此普遍。Audacity
可以讀寫這種格式。
<h3>Sun Au / NeXT</h3>






這是&nbsp;Sun 和 NeXT 預設的聲音檔案格式，它有經過些微壓縮，因此音質不如未壓縮的格式。這種檔案格式是第一種被 Web
瀏覽器支援的格式，所以在不那麼重視音質的聲音效果仍然能見到這種格式。
<p></p>






<h3>MP3 (MPEG I, Layer 3)</h3>






這是常見的壓縮聲音檔案格式。他的壓縮比高達10：1，而且音質只損失一點點。Audacity 可以匯入及匯出這種格式。更多利用 Audacity
匯出 MP3 的資訊請見&nbsp;<a href="#exportmp3">匯出 MP3&nbsp;檔案</a>。
<p></p>






<h3>Ogg Vorbis</h3>






這種壓縮聲音檔案格式是設計來作為除了 MP3 之外的另一種免費的選擇。Ogg Vorbis 檔案並不是那麼常見，不過壓縮比以及音質與 MP3
差不多〈持續地改善中〉。Audacity 可以匯入及匯出這種格式。
<hr>
<h2><a name="envelope">編輯波封</a></h2>






Audacity 讓您用波封工具直接編輯音軌的振幅：
<p>
<table border="0">






  <tbody>






    <tr>






      <td><img src="images/tool_envelope.png" height="27" width="27"></td>






      <td>波封工具 </td>






    </tr>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </tbody>
</table>






</p>






<p>在音軌的波封上加入<b>控制點</b>讓您可以編輯波封的大小，能夠漸進的改變音軌音量。每一個控制點可以控制那一個時間點的振幅〈音量〉，縮小
原本振幅最小至零，放大原本振幅最大至 150% ，附近聲音的振幅會隨之漸進的改變。
</p>






<p>下圖顯示一個開啟波封工具的音軌，會出現聲音的波封：
</p>






<p><img src="images/envelope_editing.png" height="143" width="410">
</p>






<p>在上圖中，共有五個控制點，分別位於 1.0, 3.0,
5.0, 7.0,&nbsp;9.0 秒。
Each control point has up to four "handles" arranged vertically.
The top and bottom handles are positioned at the target volume, and the
middle handles are positioned a quarter-screen down, giving you a way
to move the envelope above the 1.0 level.
</p>






<p>Note the dotted line at the top and bottom between 5.0 and 8.0
seconds.
This indicates that the actual envelope is above the screen. You can
see the entire contour by zooming vertically - position the cursor over
the vertical ruler to the left of the track and shift-click to zoom
out.
</p>






<p>To create a new control point, just click. To move a point, just
drag.
To remove a point, click on it and drag it outside of the track, then
let go.
</p>

<h2><a name="exportmp3">匯出 MP3</a></h2>






Audacity 無法自行製作 MP3 檔案，因為 MP3 編碼演算法是有專利的，直接用在免費的軟體是違法的。不過，Audacity

<center>Version 2, June 1991
</center>






<br>






<p></p>






<pre>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br></pre>






<h3>Preamble</h3>






<p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</p>






<p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</p>






<p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</p>






<p> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</p>






<p> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</p>






<p> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</p>






<p> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</p>






<p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</p>






<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>






<p>
<strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work
which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p>






<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</p>






<p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of
the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</p>






<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</p>






<p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the
Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>






<p></p>






<ul>






  <li><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute
or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads
commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.) </li>






</ul>






These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</p>






<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</p>






<p><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a
work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, --><!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. --></p>






<ul>






  <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for
at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p></p>






  </li>






  <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you
received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if
you received the program in object code or executable form with such an
offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) </li>






</ul>






The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p>






<p><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or
distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>






<p><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License,
since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</p>






<p><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any
work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
</p>






<p><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
</p>






<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</p>






<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p>






<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p>






<p><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</p>






<p><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to
address new problems or concerns.
</p>






<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software
Foundation.
</p>






<p><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program
into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</p>






<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>






<p>
<strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>






<p><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW
OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
