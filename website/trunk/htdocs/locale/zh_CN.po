"  <li>For a newly created .po file, set its properties by clicking <b>Catalog > Settings</b> and filling in the required information. Set the target language in the <b>Language</b> menu. Make sure to set the \"charset\" option correctly, otherwise poEdit will not save any translations with non-English characters. </li>\n"
"  <li>For an existing .po file, download \"audacity.pot\" or \"audacity_website.pot\" from \"Resources for Translators\" above. In poEdit, click <b>Catalog > Update from POT file</b> to update your .po file with the latest strings from the downloaded .pot file. Then translate the .po file (<b>not</b> the .pot file).</li>     \n"

"<p><b>To test a translation in Audacity:</b></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>Navigate to the \"Languages\" directory inside the Audacity installation directory, and open the directory with the same name as your .po file. If creating a new translation, create a directory in the \"Languages\" folder using the correct language code from <a href=\"http://www.poedit.net/translations.php\">http://www.poedit.net/translations.php</a>. For example, the code for Tamil is \"ta\", so create \"Audacity\\Languages\\ta\".</li>\n"

"<p><b> poEdit 基础使用方法:</b><p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>对于一个新创建的 .po 文件，单击 <b>目录Catalog > 设置Settings</b>设置属性，填好必须填的信息。在 <b>语言Language</b>菜单里设置目标语言。确保\"字符集charset\" 选项设置正确，否则 poEdit 不能保存任何非英语的字符。 </li>\n"
"  <li>对于已存在的 .po文件，从\"给翻译者的资源\"里下载最新的\"audacity.pot\" 或 \"audacity_website.pot\"。在 poEdit中，单击 <b>目录Catalog > 从POT文件更新 Update from POT file</b>可以用最新下载的pot文件更新你已存在的po文件。然后翻译.po 文件(<b>而不是</b>  .pot文件)。</li>     \n"

"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><b>要在 Audacity中测试翻译 :</b></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>浏览到Audacity安装目录里的 \"Languages\"文件夹，打开和你的 .po文件同名的文件夹。如果没有创建一个，下面是各个国家的代码，文件夹名称需与列表里的一致<a href=\"http://www.poedit.net/translations.php\">http://www.poedit.net/translations.php</a>。例如 Tamil 的代码是 \"ta\" ，则应创建一个 \"Audacity\\Languages\\ta\"文件夹。</li>\n"
"  <li>将已保存的 <b>.mo</b>文件重命名为 \"Audacity.mo\"，将其粘贴到刚刚打开或创建的文件夹里。</li>\n"
"  <li>打开Audacity ，在 <b>首选项:界面</b>里，选择你的语言然后点击OK，然后就能看见你翻译的成果了。 </li>\n"

Our long-term goal is to bring in enough money to hire a full-time developer who could devote all of his/her time to the project and take over some of the administrative,  maintenance and release tasks, freeing volunteers to spend more time on code."
