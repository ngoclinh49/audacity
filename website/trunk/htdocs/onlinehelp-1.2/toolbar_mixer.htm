The Mixer Toolbar has three controls, used to set the volume levels of
your audio device and choose the input source.  The leftmost slider
controls the output volume, the other slider controls the recording
volume, and the control on the right lets you choose the input
source (such as "Microphone", "Line In", "Audio CD", etc.).
<b>Note:</b> On Windows Vista or 7, you must use the "Recording Device" 
dropdown in the "Audio I/O" tab of Preferences to select input sources.
</p>

<p>Use the
<a href="toolbar_meter.htm">Record Level Meter</a> to check that
you are setting an approriate recording level (setting the 
recording slider so that the loudest parts of the recording reach 
about -6 dB is a safe choice). 
</p>

<p>Changing these controls has no effect on the audio data in your
project - in other words it doesn't matter what the output volume
level is when you Export or Save a project - the end result is the
same.</p>
