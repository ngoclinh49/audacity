In Audacity 1.3, this is replaced by a fully functional Selection Bar, which displays and controls the current selection (your choice of Start and End, or Start and Length), and the current audio position.  The selection bar is fully editable - just click in any field and type to change the current selection precisely.  In addition, many formatting options allow you to view times in different units, such as samples, CD frames, or NTSC video frames.")?>
