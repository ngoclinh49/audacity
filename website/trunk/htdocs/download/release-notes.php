  <li><p><?=_("Audacity can import and display MIDI files, but cannot play or edit them.")?></p></li>
  <li><p><?=_("Linux:  Recording in full duplex (playing existing tracks while recording) on some systems causes mono recordings to sound distorted or low-pitched.  To work around this problem, set Audacity to record in stereo.")?></p></li>
  <li><p><?=_("MacOS X: Audacity cannot work with files or folders that are contained inside folders with non-English characters (accents, symbols, etc.) in their names.  Files with accented characters work, and Audacity projects with accented characters work.  Only folders with accented characters in their names will cause problems.")?></p></li>

<?=_("<h3>Changes in Audacity 1.2.6</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed memory leaks on Windows.
</li>

<li>Corrected font size problems.
</li>

<li>Enabled missing FLAC support.
</li>

<li>Fixed Mac OS X (PPC only) screen redraw issues.
</li>")?>

</ul>

<?=_("<h3>Changes in Audacity 1.2.5</h3>
<ul>
<li>An official Intel Mac version is now available.
</li>
<li>Fixed bug in Generate Silence which caused it to apply to all tracks
    instead of just the selected ones.
</li>
<li>Mac OS X: audio device opening code has been rewritten.  First, it
    is much more conservative about changing device settings; it will
    not change settings when you open the program or close the
    preferences dialog anymore, and it will not change the settings when
    you begin playback/recording if the current settings are adequate.
    When it does change the settings, it should work much better on
    devices such as the Griffin iMic, ART USB Phono Plus,
    and Ion iMX02 USB.
</li>
<li>Mac OS X: added new Audio I/O preference that lets you tell Audacity
    to never change any audio device settings.
</li>
<li>Newer libsndfile supports FLAC import and export
</li>
<li>Updated soundtouch to current version which is faster and better quality
</li>
<li>Modified configure script prefers system libraries to local copies to
    reduce compilation times and memory usage.
</li>
<li>Minor updates to help files.
</li>
<li>New or updated translations: Bulgarian (bg), Galician (gl),
    Traditional Chinese (zh_TW), Simplified Chinese (zh), Slovenian (sl),
    Swedish (sv), Bangladeshi (bn), Slovakian (sk), Romanian (ro),
    Lithuanian (lt), Welsh (cy), and Turkish (tr).

<ul>
<li>The File menu now includes a list of recent files.

    quality and file compression.

</li>
<li>Dragging sound files into the Audacity window now works on Mac OS X
    and Linux, as well as Windows.  (Before, it worked only on Windows.)

</li>
<li>Better support for certain audio devices on Mac OS X 10.4 \"Tiger\"

</li>
<li>The \"View History\" window can now discard old undo levels to save disk
    space on Windows.  (This previously worked only on Linux and Mac.)

</li>
<li>\"Preferences\" command is now in Edit menu.

</li>
<li>\"Plot Spectrum\" command is now in Analyze menu.

</li>

    (instead of open it) displays an intelligent error message.

</li>
