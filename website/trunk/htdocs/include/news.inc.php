     dragging to the Audacity icon.</li>    
    <li>(OS X) Audio Unit plug-ins are not loaded until used. This makes Audacity

     incompatible plug-ins</a>.</li>
    <li>(Windows) On a very few machines, the <i>Windows WDM-KS</i> low latency
     host caused Audacity 2.0.4 to hang or the computer to crash. WDM-KS has been 
     removed from Audacity 2.0.5 while we work on safely enabling this host. 
     WDM-KS will still be available for testing in the Windows
     <a href=\"http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Nightly_Builds\">
     alpha development builds</a>.</li>
    <li>(Windows) Fixed a bug where Audacity would not record until the current input 
     was reselected. </li>
    <li>(Linux) You can now navigate through an effect or other dialog using keyboard TAB.</li>
  </ul>
Other bugs have been fixed, notably shaped dither being too loud, as detailed in the

<a href=\"/download\">Audacity 1.3.7 (Beta)</a> 
for Windows, Mac and Linux/Unix. 
</p>
<p>This is primarily a bug-fix release. It significantly improves
stability and usability, especially on Mac OS X, but incorporates some
new features too.

<b>Cross-Platform Bug Fixes include:</b>
                <ul>
                       <li>Muting/soloing caused incorrect channel results in exported

                                       <li>Export as WAV could be corrupted if overwriting
                                            to same file, uncompressed Export Multiple 
                                            only produced 16-bit WAV</li>
                                       <li>MP3 and WMA now export correctly with all supported

                        <li>Restored support for multi-channel recording devices that
                            can record more than two channels using Audacity</li>
                </ul>
</p>
<p>

                       <li><i>Mac OS X only:</i> fixes for inactive or corrupted

it is recommended for more advanced users. For all users,

      <li><b>Linked audio and label tracks</b> allow labels to move with
              their corresponding audio when cutting, pasting or changing
              speed or tempo</li>
      <li><b>Hierarchical plug-in grouping</b> for built-in plug-ins

<p>
<b>Other experimental features:</b> Sound activated recording; ability to
save smaller, compressed project files; MIDI files can now be imported,
cut-and-paste edited, then exported.

The book - dubbed \"Audacity kompakt\" (A compact guide to Audacity) - was written by 
author Markus Priemer, who was supported by German Audacity developer Markus Meyer.
The latter also added a foreword. The book aims to be an introduction to 
beginners who want to get started quickly with Audacity, but also acts as a reference
for more experienced users. It not only features an introduction to how digital 
audio works but also many tips and tricks for using Audacity.
